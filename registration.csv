The High-Throughput Toxicokinetic (HTTK) tool is a modeling program built as a R package consisting of PBTK models that efficiently evaluate large number (> 500) of compounds. In our current work, we first chose 20 compounds (12 in humans and 8 in rats), to assess the extrapolation performance of the PBTK model. Available in vitro estimates such as intrinsic hepatic clearance (Clmet) and fraction unbound in plasma (Fub) were used as input for HTTK-PBTK to predict in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters such as maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC).  A literature search was conducted to gather measured Cmax and AUC for the compounds investigated for model verification purposes. Overall, we found the PBTK model to give a reasonable estimate of in vivo pharmacokinetics in humans and rats. However, there exists room for further refinements as the current model predictions in general overestimate Cmax and AUC by approximately 4-fold in humans and <20 fold in rats. In this work, we calibrated the appropriate correction factors for all compounds: Clmet in humans and rats, for 8 out of 20 compounds needed to be increased by 1.5-30.4 fold and for the remaining compounds, the Fub needed to be increased by 1.4-37.6 fold. Parameter refinements resulted in closer predictions of observed pharmacokinetic data. In our work, we have shown that additional adjustments were required to correct for the generalized overestimation of in vivo pharmacokinetics by the HTTK-PBTK model. Extension of our work to a larger list of chemicals might help in developing a normalized correction factor to make IVIVE a success using the HTTK-PBTK modeling tool.",Herbivore (Vegetarian),7/5/18 14:38

Allen and Analiz Rodriguez, M.D., Ph.D.",University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,,"Radiation exposure due to radiological terrorism, industrial accidents, or military missions is a continuing threat for the civilian population. The potential for accidental radiation exposure will become greater with the expected rise in nuclear power plant construction to meet growing demands for energy. In addition, sub-lethal doses of whole brain irradiation are commonly administered therapeutically. However, presently there are no known ways to ameliorate the negative effects of radiation on the brain. Radiation induced cognitive dysfunction is the main deleterious effect on the brain caused by oxidative stress. Postbiomodulation (PBM) is an emerging non-invasive technique that administers non-infrared light to tissues. PBM could become a countermeasure or treatment plan for radiation exposure. The aim of the current study is to assess whether PBM affects mitochondrial respiration in hippocampal cells - specifically, the redox signaling in the mitochondria. Mice were treated with 2 separate radiation paradigms.  Group 1: 20 three-month-old male mice received whole body 137Cs irradiation and PBM 3 times per week. Group 2: 20 six-month-old mice received 10Gy cranial irradiation on the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform and 3 single doses of PBM. 4 weeks following irradiation, group 1 was tested for hippocampus-dependent cognitive performance in the Y-maze and Morris water-maze, and group 2 was tested in the Y-Maze, novel object recognition, and sociability. Following behavior testing, the oxygen consumption rate was measured from extracted neuronal mitochondria cells. Control and PBM-treated + radiation mice showed a significant preference for the novel arm compared to the familiar and start arms. Sham PBM-treated + radiation mice showed no preference and spent about the same amount of time in all 3 arms during the retention. The present data provides the first evidence that PBM ameliorates the effects of radiation on short-term memory in adult male mice.",Omnivore,7/5/18 14:00

Every year P. falciparum causes 225 million cases of malaria and nearly one million deaths, most of which are young children and pregnant women. The use of insecticide-treated bed nets and insecticide spray campaigns have allowed inroads to be made in the control of malaria in recent years; however, P. falciparum continues to run rampant. There are many factors contributing to the inability of health officials to eradicate malaria, including high rates of drug-resistance in the parasite and mosquito population. Also, P. falciparum appears to both evade and disable the immune system by a variety of mechanisms that allows it to persist in the host. Sex seems to influence the development of disease and immunity against malaria. Generally, adult females mount stronger innate and adaptive immune responses than adult males. This results in faster clearance of pathogens and more effective vaccines in females compared to males, but this also contributes to increased susceptibility to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in women. In lab, we have used the murine mouse model and the literature on sex differences in immune response to conduct several experiments testing the hypothesis that there is a difference in how males and females combat a malarial infection. CD19-/- and CD28-/- of both sexes fail to clear the infection, as well as female CD19/28-/- mice, but CD19/28-/- male mice control the infection as well or better than wild type mice of either sex.",Omnivore,7/5/18 9:10

Foley,National Center for Toxicological Research,,"Antibiotics such as tetracyclines have been widely used to combat infectious diseases in humans and other organisms and to improve growth in food animals. The misuse of antimicrobial agents has become a major concern for healthcare facilities as well as crop and livestock farms. The proliferation of multidrug resistant bacteria like Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli jeopardize food safety and future drug therapies as antibiotics become less effective in inhibiting these bacteria. Multidrug resistance arises from a myriad of mechanisms and among those, conjugation is a common means of transfer of resistance genes on plasmids. Under different selective pressures (type and concentration of antibiotic), conjugal transfer of multidrug resistance plasmids is known to vary in efficiency between different S. enterica strains; however, the relative impact of antimicrobial exposure on the dissemination of plasmids that confer resistance are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the conjugation efficiency of multidrug resistant plasmids under different antibiotic concentrations and identified which plasmids were transferred under different selective pressures. Conjugative assays designed with serial dilutions of different antibiotics were conducted to determine the impact of exposure to different concentrations of the antibiotics on conjugation efficiency. This was determined as the amount of transconjugants recovered following antibiotic exposure relative to non-exposed control transconjugants. To identify which plasmids were transferred, transconjugants were randomly picked from each plate and subjected to replicon typing using the primers for replicons identified in the donor strains. Our preliminary results showed that there was a dose-dependent impact on plasmid transfer efficiency and S. enterica strain-level variability in conjugation dynamics following tetracycline exposure.",Omnivore,7/5/18 14:13

Bennett,National Center for Toxicological Research,,Y. Ahn,National Center for Toxicological Research,,,Arkansas State University,,"Tetracyclines, a class of broad-spectrum polyketide antimicrobial agents, are used in humans as a therapeutic agent and in the livestock industry as a feed-additive to facilitate growth of animals and to treat clinical disease. Wide-spread clinical use has expanded tetracycline resistance through three mechanisms: tetracycline efflux, ribosomal protection and tetracycline modification. The goal of this study was to screen the Human gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota for the presence of ten recently discovered genes: tet(X) and tet(47)-(56); tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) capable of enzymatically inactivating tetracycline via modification, and to determine whether exposure to residual levels of tetracycline has direct effect on TRG concentration and the survival of intestinal bacterial species. Continuous-culture studies determined the steady state and tetracycline spiking point of Human fecal samples to be 3 days. 5 tetracycline concentrations (0.015, 0.15, 1.5, 15, and 150 ug/ml) and a control were applied to the samples with exposure periods of 4-7 days. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) determined the intrinsic and inducible TRG profile of the fecal samples to include tet(X) and tet(52), with genomic sequencing determining a match of tet(X) with 97% certainty. Real-Time PCR (qPCR) with 10 ng/ul samples of fecal gDNA determined that tet(X) concentration is variable and decreasing in the steady state, and time-dependent following tetracycline addition. Time-series analysis of the qPCR data following the tetracycline spike shows no distinct pattern with respect to tet(X), implying the concentration of tet(X) is independent of tetracycline dosage. These findings suggest that tet(X) and tet(52) are present in the Human GI tract, but do not confer large levels of tetracycline resistance on intestinal bacterial species. Ongoing studies will include characterizing tetracycline-resistant bacterial isolates by the presence or absence of the tet(X) and tet(52) TRGs.",Omnivore,7/2/18 14:08

While traditionally regarded as an extracellular bacterium, current literature contains conflicting reports of S. aureus survival and replication within eukaryotic host cells.  To better understand the pathogenesis of S. aureus pneumonia in humans, it is important to define S. aureus interactions within lung cells, particularly the first innate immune cell responder, macrophages.  S. aureus survives and replicates in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. However, murine cells lack human-specific S. aureus toxin receptors and vastly differ in the physiological response to S. aureus toxins compared to human cells.  In our laboratory, we use primary human alveolar macrophages (hAMs) as a novel pulmonary infection platform.  Using this system, we observe S. aureus strains LAC (methicillin resistant, USA300 clonal lineage) and UAMS-1 (methicillin sensitive, USA200 clonal lineage) do not replicate as efficiently in hAMs as in murine macrophages.  Macrophages display distinct polarization profiles that impact the response to invading pathogens, including the microbicidal M1 phenotype and the less inflammatory, immune-regulatory M2 polarization.  Additionally, these polarizations may coexist in culture.  We therefore hypothesize that RAW 264.7 murine macrophages display a M2 phenotype conducive to S. aureus survival and replication, whereas hAMs have a predominant M1 profile.  Using immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analysis, we will assess polarization of species-specific cell types via identification of the M1 and M2 markers, C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 10 (CXCL10) and Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), respectively.  We will then compare and contrast macrophage phenotypes that are conducive to S. aureus survival and replication in both hAMs and murine macrophages.",Omnivore,7/5/18 7:50

The contraction of the SMAs rotates the solar panel so that the sunlight is incident on it normally throughout the day, resulting in the maximum amount of energy being absorbed.

Aggressive radiation treatments are vital to effectively treat tumors, but excess radiation is harmful to surrounding tissues in addition to other side effects. Nanoparticle-based radiation enhancers are in clinical trials for increasing effectiveness and minimizing damage to normal tissue. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have easily functionalized surfaces, excellent X-ray absorption capabilities, and are biocompatible. The goal of this project is to investigate radioenhancement in vitro via cellular internalization of AuNPs with a variety of surface coatings. Internalization of AuNPs by receptor mediated endocytosis is influenced by size, shape,  surface ligands, charge, and other attributes. Here, AuNPs are investigated with different surface coatings. Physiochemical properties of the AuNPs were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV-vis spectroscopy. Radiation enhancement was tested in vitro by standard clonogenic assays. The clonogenic assay was optimized without AuNPs to determine optimal plating concentrations of two cell lines: human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HcT-116) and human fibrosarcoma (HT-1080). The clonogenic assay was then used to evaluate the radioenhancement of each AuNP variation. Citrate-AuNPs show the greatest effect of radioenhancement, while PEGylated AuNPs did not show significant enhancement compared to cells irradiated without AuNPs. This is possible because citrate-AuNPs are readily internalized despite having limited colloidal stability in biological matrix. Further studies are being conducted to understand the cellular internalization and mechanism of radioenhancement through a variety of microscopic, spectroscopic, and in vitro studies. Results from these studies will indicate what physicochemical attributes can have better radioenhancement in vitro to pose appropriate questions related to regulatory science.",Gluten Free,7/5/18 13:40

Cancer cells are characterized by their unregulated growth patterns as well as their enhanced survivability. The Abbott lab is specifically looking into membrane proteins that are overexpressed in glioblastoma cancer as well as many other cancer types. One type of membrane protein known as glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor proteins (GPI-AP) is increased in expression in many epithelial tumors. GPI anchor proteins are membrane proteins with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (glycan and lipid) attached to the C-terminus of the protein. The multiple subunit enzyme responsible for the cleavage and subsequent addition of the GPI anchor to proteins is known as the GPI transamidase (GPIT).  The subunit of the GPI transamidase that is responsible for the transamidation reaction is GPAA1.  GPAA1 is increased at very high levels in glioblastoma indicating that there will be an increase in GPI-APs. We are isolating the GPI-APs using Triton X-114 phase separation membrane protein extraction procedure and characterizing them using mass spectrometry.

In order to assess the influence of antimicrobial exposure on the conjugation efficiency of such plasmids, this study will quantify the rates of plasmid transfer under multiple exposure conditions and will apply RNA sequencing to determine genes that may be differently expressed during drug exposure and conjugal transfer. The objective will be to classify the fundamental genetic mechanisms that impact the differences in conjugation. As a means to achieve these goals, conjugation assays will be subject to various selective pressures (different antibiotics with numerous concentrations) to identify the influence of the exposure to different antibiotic concentrations on the efficiency of conjugation. Following the exposure, these assays will be evaluated based on the number of transconjugants recovered in comparison to non-antimicrobial exposed controls. Thereafter, mRNA will be isolated in selective samples where the conjugation efficiency is considerably different in contrast to non-exposed controls. These isolations will be made in order to evaluate the distinctions in gene expressions on, using RNA sequencing-based methods on the Miseq.

It is the 5th and 7th most common cancer for males and females, respectively in the United States. Other than in the skin, this cancer can also develop in the eyes and in internal organs such as the intestines. The risk of melanoma is higher in people under 40, especially in Caucasian women. In 2011, melanoma incidence and death rates were 19.7 and 2.7 per 100,000, respectively. The cost of treating of newly diagnosed melanomas will increase from $457 million in 2011 to an estimated $1.6 billion in 2030. Additional efforts are required to prevent the incidence, death, and health care cost of this disease. Development of new therapeutic options are urgently needed to treat this rapidly rising malignancy. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that synthesis and anti-melanoma studies of novel thiazole-androstenone derivatives will lead to the discovery of potent anti-melanoma agents. Reaction of thioamide and thiourea derivatives with 6B-bromoandrostenedione has resulted the formation of thiazole-androstenone derivatives instead of thiazolino-androstenone derivatives. This serendipitous methodology has been utilized to synthesize more than 60 novel molecules. These molecules has been tested against NCI-60 cancer cell lines.

Boehme,University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,,,Arkansas State University,,"Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) is a segmented, double-stranded RNA virus that infects a wide range of hosts, including humans. Most people become infected with reovirus during early childhood, although infections are typically subclinical. Previous work from our laboratory revealed that reovirus non-structural protein σ1s facilitates reovirus replication by promoting viral protein synthesis. However, the mechanism by which σ1s enhances reovirus protein synthesis is not known. One of the major roadblocks to understanding σ1s function is the lack of an antibody specific for σ1s. The goal of this project is to synthesize recombinant σ1s to use as an antigen for antibody production. Our approach is to use an inducible bacterial expression system to produce the σ1s protein. Past attempts to purify σ1s failed because the full-length protein was insoluble. Here, we divided the protein into two sections, an N-terminal fragment and a C-terminal fragment. We hypothesize that one half of the protein will be soluble and amenable to purification. The fragments were cloned into an IPTG-inducible system and 6x-His or GST tags were added to facilitate the purification process. Under normal conditions σ1s is not synthesized, but after addition of IPTG σ1s will be produced. We will assess the induction and solubility of N- and C- terminal fragments of σ1s from two different reovirus strains, type 1 Lang (T1L) and type 3 Dearing (T3D). For those constructs that are soluble, we will attempt to purify the protein using nickel- or GST- affinity chromatography for the 6x-His and GST tags, respectively. Once the protein is purified, it will be injected into rats to create an antibody that can be used for studies of σ1s. This reagent will help provide insight into how reoviruses translate their proteins in host cells.",Omnivore,7/4/18 9:42

Cotinine is the main metabolite of nicotine in humans. As the population shifts from smoking cigarettes to vaping, more and more people have started to use e-cigarettes. Even though the percent of nicotine is lower in vape juices, people tend to vape at a higher frequency than they would smoke cigarettes. This could lead to an increase in the amount of nicotine being metabolized in the body and then released into our water systems via urine. Because algae is a primary consumer, many other organisms rely on algae for energy. If an increase in nicotine consumption has an effect on algal growth, other organisms may be affected as well.
The effect of cotinine on the environment was researched by observing S. capricornutum’s response to varying concentrations of cotinine. Using the guidelines in the Printz Algal Assay, algae was grown with varying concentrations of cotinine added to the media in 2L-flasks. One flask was a negative control, and three flasks had increasing concentrations of cotinine. After a week of growth, the algal cells were counted to determine if there was a significant difference in cell count from the control group with no cotinine.

The DRG contain the cell bodies of a collection of sensory neurons that include nociceptors: the neurons that sense painful stimuli. In an ongoing attempt to understand how the correct number of neurons are formed in the correct locations during embryonic development, this study attempts to characterize part of the gene regulatory network that is required to generate pain-sensing nociceptors in the DRG during embryonic development. One key gene that is involved in this network is the transcription factor neurogenin1 (neurog1). Neurog1 is expressed by progenitor cells in the DRG and this gene is required for the generation of nociceptors since knockout mice that lack the neurog1 gene do not produce nociceptive neurons. Because neurog1 is a transcription factor, we hypothesize that it is a key node in the gene regulatory network that produces nociceptors and that transcriptional targets of the neurog1 gene are also members of this network. To identify transcriptional targets of the neurog1 gene, we have compared the transcriptome of embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) cervical dorsal root ganglia from wild-type and neurog1 knockout embryos. Differential gene expression analysis has identified several genes that are downregulated in the knockout and therefore are potential transcriptional targets of the neurog1 gene. To confirm the differential expression of the genes identified in the transcriptome analysis, we are currently examining their mRNA expression pattern in the cervical DRG of wild-type and neurog1 knockout E11.5 embryos by in situ hybridization with complementary RNA probes.

Given the widespread clinical use of androgen receptor targeted therapies in prostate cancer, new biomarkers are desperately needed identify, monitor, and potentially prevent the development of t-NEPC. Using bioinformatic analyses of whole exome and transcriptome sequencing databases, we have identified several members of the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family as being highly dysregulated among an NEPC cohort. TTSP family members are frequently overexpressed in human cancers where they have been implicated in degradation of the basement membrane and progression to metastasis, thus highlighting their potential utility in adaptive disease. Of the TTSPs identified, hepsin was most frequently amplified and/or overexpressed, suggesting a potential role for this enzyme in the molecular pathogenesis of NEPC. Here, we examined the effect of cyclic AMP (cAMP) induced terminal neuroendocrine differentiation on hepsin expression levels in a human model of prostate adenocarcinoma, LNCaP, and whether inhibition of hepsin expression could prevent cAMP induced differentiation in this cell line.

In addition, rhesus monkey can exhibit similar signs and effects when infected with Campylobacter more closely to humans than any other animal models would. This study aims to characterize a total of 12 Campylobacter species isolated from the fecal sample of rhesus monkey using Bruker MALDI Biotyper and then use whole genome sequencing (WGS) to detect any antimicrobial and aerotolerance property present in Campylobacter. Protein profile based identification, Bruker MALDI Biotyper, classified 100% (12/12) of the isolates as Campylobacter; 83% (10/12) of which were Campylobacter coli and the remaining 17% (2/12) were Campylobacter jejuni.

Classically defined as a movement disorder, PD is also associated with a variety of cognitive impairments. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to research functional connectivity (FC) of the brain in patients with PD and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Rs-fMRI provides an opportunity to study correlated patterns of activity in the brain, known as resting state networks (RSNs). A common method of identifying RSNs is through the use of Independent Components Analysis (ICA). This data-driven approach yields spatial maps of correlated brain regions without any a priori assumptions rather than a parcellated predetermined locale. Correlations across the timecourses of the independent components can then be statistically compared in a matrix to quantify the FC among RSNs and the differences between the PD and HC groups. Neuroimaging data included a 7-minute rs-fMRI scan, a T1-weighted anatomical scan, and a B0 field map. Data were imported to the FSL processing suite (fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSL). 34 subjects (XPD, YHC, ZMale) were analyzed.

Hypertension is highly prevalent in populations with high dietary salt intake, but the mechanisms causing salt-sensitive hypertension are imperfectly defined. Recent work in our laboratory indicates that massively accumulated T cells in the kidney represent a major defect stimulating renal tubules, resulting in salt retention and consequent development of salt-sensitive hypertension. However, how T cells accumulated into the kidney is a critical question remains to be answered. Since T cell-infiltration into the kidney is possibly driven by renal perfusion pressure, we hypothesize a vicious cycle that during development of salt-sensitive hypertension, initial elevated blood pressure promote T cells infiltrating into the kidneys, where they further stimulate renal tubule to reabsorb more salt, exacerbating salt retention and salt-sensitive hypertension. Here, we plan to associate the time course of blood pressure elevation and T cell infiltration into the kidneys in a classic model of salt-sensitive hypertension, Deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA-salt)-treated mice. Blood pressures of these mice are continuously recorded using radio-telemetry system, and T cells in their kidneys are freshly isolated at days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 during the treatment and analyzed using flow-cytometry. In agreement with an early study that immune deficient mice fail to maintain hypertension in the later phase of DOCA-salt treatment, We expect that moderately elevated blood pressure in early phase (days 1-7) will significantly increase T cell-accumulation in the kidneys of DOCA-salt mice, and these T cells will stimulate a further elevation of blood pressure in the later phase (days 14-21). The goal of this study is to determine the chicken or egg relation between T cell infiltration into the kidney and the development of salt-sensitive hypertension.",Omnivore,7/2/18 17:18

Gilmore,Hendrix College,,Andrew Schurko,Hendrix College,,,Arkansas State University,,"Bdelloid rotifers are a class of aquatic microinvertebrates with a DNA repair system that allows them to withstand DNA damage induced by desiccation and ionizing radiation. A previous transcriptome (RNA-Seq) analysis with the bdelloid Adineta vaga revealed an unusual DNA ligase gene that was upregulated following irradiation. The objective of this project was to determine the role of this DNA ligase homolog during DNA repair in A. vaga. First, bioinformatics analysis revealed that the DNA ligase gene has homologs in certain eukaryotic and prokaryotic lineages, but is absent in many model organisms, such as humans, fruit flies and yeast.  The domain structure of the bdelloid DNA ligase protein is also distinct from canonical DNA ligases I, III, and IV. Next, we used real-time PCR to demonstrate that the bdelloid DNA ligase gene is upregulated during recovery from DNA damage induced by desiccation. This was consistent with results from RNA-Seq data with irradiated bdelloids. To understand the role of this protein in DNA repair, we generated a 6x Histidine-tagged DNA ligase protein. We used the protein in electrophoretic mobility shift assays to identify preference for double-stranded, single-stranded, or nicked DNA templates. Finally, we developed resources for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to test if DNA repair is affected when the DNA ligase gene is deleted. We generated two single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and used in vitro Cas9 cleavage assays to show that each sgRNA targets and induces cutting of the ligase gene. We cloned the sgRNAs into a plasmid that contains the Cas9 gene, which was used to transfect A. vaga. PCR was used to measure expression of Cas9 and the sgRNAs. In summary, bioinformatics analysis, protein expression assays, and anticipated CRISPR/Cas9 results will help to understand the function of this unusual DNA ligase gene in the DNA repair mechanism of bdelloid rotifers.",Omnivore,7/5/18 14:13

Therefore, GLS inhibitors are currently under development and have been shown to be promising anti-cancer drugs. Of these CB839 is the most potent inhibitor, however, in recent phase II clinical trial, CB839 has shown some adverse kidney effects. To study the potential cytotoxic effects of CB839 in the kidney, we treated normal kidney cells (NRK) and lung tumor cells (A427) with varying concentrations of CB839 and assessed cell viability. Cell viability was assessed by using various plate based viability assays and colony formation assay. First we performed a cell titration experiment to determine the linear range of the plate viability assays. Then we generated the dose response of CB839 in NRK and A427 cells.

These drugs including, the one used in this study, FDA approved vorinostat, are capable of multiple actions and are considered to be multifunctional drugs.  Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are chromatin-modifying enzymes that are involved in a number of cellular events, such as tissue differentiation, autophagy, apoptosis, migration, mitosis and angiogenesis.  High levels of HDACs have been detected in some cancers. Early studies in our laboratory showed different effects by vorinostat  on global HDAC activity in several triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) subtypes. This study focused on HDAC 7, which  has been associated with increases in  cancer stem cells and poor prognosis.   Cancer stem cells play an important role in cancer resistance to therapy. Histone deacetylase inhibitors are emerging as therapy for triple negative breast cancer, which is currently an unmet need in women’s health due to the lack of targeted therapies. This study investigated the effects of vorinostat on apoptosis and the modulation of HDAC 7 expression  in two subtypes of triple negative breast cancers, MB231(MSL) and HCC70 (BL-2). Flow cytometry and immunostaining was conducted to determine vorinostat   effects on  expression of two  cancer stem cell (CSC)  markers, CD44 and CD 24.  Western blot and real-time PCR showed significantly decrease (10-fold) in the expression of HDAC 7 by vorinostat in HCC70 cells. A modest decrease (3-fold) was also observed in MB231 cells.  Immunostaining and flow cytometry also showed decreased in CD44 by vorinostat in MB231 cells. This study demonstrated that vorinostat exert its anti-cancer effects through several mechanisms, such as inducing apoptosis, down-regulating HDAC 7 and decreasing cancer stem cells.

MC4R is expressed in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus.

These neurons are found in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), and are responsible for food intake. It has been shown that high fat (HF) diet induces injury to the hypothalamus. The goal of this project is to study the effect of HF diet on MC4R protein expression and MC4R neurons.  Mice expressing the endogenous MC4R was tagged with a HA epitope (MC4R-HA mice), and were used to visualize MC4R in the brain.

Cerniglia,National Center for Toxicological Research,,"The use of Triclosan (TCS) as a broad-spectrum antibiotic in a multitude of consumer goods like over-the-counter antiseptics has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the purported bactericidal properties. Possible risk factors have been associated with such chemical, including antibacterial resistance, ecotoxicity, and endocrine disruption leading to a concern of whether Triclosan’s benefits outweigh its hazards. Here, we tested the susceptibility of different bacteria including Escherichia Coli, Salmonella Enterica, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium Longum, Bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron and Akkermansia muciniphila to TCS and we further examined whether TCS can increase bacterial resistance to antibiotics. TCS was dissolved in water or 10% Propylene Glycerol or 0.05% Tween 20 and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for each bacterial species was determined using optical density measurements at OD600 nm in Cytation3 Cell Imaging Multimode Reader. Specifically, each bacterial species were grown in their respective growth media in presence (Concentration ranging from 0.5 to 100 μg/ml)) or absence (served as control) of TCS for 24 hours, with a recording of OD at a 30 minute interval. Results showed that TCS MICs ranged from 3 to 5 μg/ml. Some bacterial species (E. faecium, L. acidophilus, B. Longum) were resistant to TCS. TCS dissolved in Tween 20 has the highest antimicrobial effect observed. Escherichia Coli resistance to antibiotics in presence and absence of TCS was assessed by measuring the zone of inhibition of bacteria growing in molten Muller-Hinton agar plates. Further experiments using fecal samples from rats due to their similarity to human feces could reveal whether TCS influences intestinal commensal bacteria.",Omnivore,7/5/18 18:27

An intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) is an invasive technique used to measure the brain potentials through a mesh of electrodes placed directly on the surface of the brain. Several studies have suggested that epileptic seizures emerge from specific pre-ictal changes that develop over long timescales and predispose the brain to seizure. This study uses iEEG recordings of epilepsy patients to analyze the pre-ictal and post-ictal periods using power spectral density (PSD) and functional brain connectivity measures as possible makers of epilepsy. Each patient’s recordings were divided into epochs that consist of the combination of 300 seconds pre-ictal, the ictal period, and 300 seconds post-ictal; only clinical seizure data was used. Data was preprocessed and analyzed using Brainstorm software. We applied a bandpass filter between 0.1-300 Hz and notch filtered for power noise (60Hz) removal. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Signal-Space Projector (SSP) were applied to each epoch to remove cardiac, eye, and muscular artifacts. We calculated the relative PSD via Welch's method and efficiency measures from functional connectivity analysis from the pre-ictal and post-ictal epochs. We extracted and preprocessed 20 iEEG epochs. The results showed an increase in brain activity within the delta band (1-4 Hz) of approximately 14.47% and varying decreases in activity in the theta (5-8 Hz), alpha (9-13 Hz), beta (14-25 Hz), and gamma (25-90, 100-200 Hz) bands. Functional connectivity will be will be explored in the coming weeks, as will the relationship between the relative PSD in the different frequency bands and their efficiency measures.",Herbivore (Vegetarian),7/5/18 16:01

Usually, CaM binds to a disordered region and causes the region to have an alpha-helical secondary structure. Calcineurin (CaN) is a calcium and CaM dependent protein that activates T-cells. PEP-19 is a disordered 62 amino acid protein that binds to CaM and alters CaM’s calcium binding kinetics. We used these three proteins to explore and develop a time and labor efficient method for producing proteins in E. coli in an undergraduate laboratory setting. The original method for preparing these proteins was standard IPTG induction, which is problematic for undergraduate labs due to the time-frame required for monitoring cell growth. Autoinduction is a unique method that uses specific proportions of glycerol, glucose, and lactose,a mixture called 5052, to cause the production of protein without needing to monitor cell growth. Traditionally, autoinduction utilizes a specific autoinduction media which contains a complex variety of ingredients making it costly and time consuming to make. The IPTG method often requires the use of a simple, cost effective media called Terrific Broth (TB) that utilizes glycerol as the carbohydrate source. We hypothesized that TB could be used instead of IPTG and Autoinduction, to eliminate most of the time restraints that accompany the two methods. This is accompished by using the TB media from ITPG method and the 5052 mixture from autoinduction. Here we compare the expression of calmodulin, PEP-19, and calcineurin utilizing the IPTG method, standard autoinduction method, and autoinduction method using TB and 5052 to determine if utilization of TB and 5052 can provide a convenient, cost effective alternative to the IPTG and standard autoinduction methods.",Omnivore,6/20/18 15:27

Previously treatable illnesses are now not responsive to some antibiotics. This growing resistance problem leads us to a search for antibiotics that could offer new treatment options. Tuberculosis, though not a common problem in the United States, is one of the more serious illnesses among the antibiotic resistance spectrum. Antibiotic resistant strains of pathogens are generally caused by the misuse of therapeutic antibiotics. Once these resistant antibiotic strains are present in a population, they are more likely to spread and infect others. In areas where proper treatment is not available for tuberculosis, antibiotic resistant strains begin to grow out of control.  

Throughout this project, we are looking for alternative antibiotics that could potentially be used to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. However, because of the risks associated with using M. tuberculosis in the lab, Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 was used as a surrogate.  M. smegmatis is similar in cell structure and size to M. tuberculosis, leading us to believe the results of the antibiotics on M. smegmatis would be comparable to those on M. tuberculosis. 

Antibiotics were produced from different soil bacteria grown in either peptone starved or glucose starved media, and the antibiotics were extracted using an acetonitrile:water:acetic acid solvent. The extracted antibiotics were tested against M. smegmatis to determine their success at inhibiting cellular respiration. The effectiveness of the lab-produced antibiotics was determined using 2,3,5-triphenylatetrazolium chloride (TTC) and was compared to that of isoniazid, a commercial antibiotic commonly used in tuberculosis treatment.

The jelly material of leaf consists of approximately 99% water and remaining 1% with several minerals, vitamins, polysaccharides, and biologically active phenolic compounds. A major constituent of Aloe Vera leaf extracts is aloin - a phenolic molecule, that exists in two isoforms (aloin A and B). Both, Aloe Vera and aloin possess several therapeutic and pharmaceutical properties including antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, antipyretic, and anti-cancer effect.  Hence, these are widely marketed as a raw material, as well as in beverages, lotions, sunscreens and other consumer products. In vivo animal studies have shown that consumption of whole leaf extract or purified aloe-products caused intestinal goblet cell hyperplasia and malignancy. Recently, we have shown by in vitro that aloin has detrimental effects on certain human intestinal commensal bacteria.  

The present study will determine aloin’s effect on the intestinal fecal microbiota under anaerobic condition. Rat fecal-slurry (3% fecal was made using low carbohydrate medium) was incubated with varying concentrations of aloin. Samples were taken at different time points (3, 6 and 24 hr) and tested the live bacterial population. Low aloin concentrations showed minor alterations in bacteria growth, whereas high concentrations specifically increased Lactobacillus spp. and decreased aerobic bacteria counts. Short chain fatty acid production was also tested for through a HPLC method. It revealed that aloin specifically decreases the production of butyrate. 16s rRNA sequencing data also shows that aloin decreases the abundance of butyrate-producing bacterial species. Aloin can also be potentially metabolized into an anthraquinone by intestinal commensal bacteria.  The present study investigates the intestinal microbiota’s ability to metabolize aloin.

ESKAPE bacteria (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter barman, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.) cause 80% of nosocomial infections in the United States. They are of special concern because multi-drug resistance among them can cause life-threatening nosocomial infections. It is difficult to get effective antibacterial agents to treat Gram-negative bacterial infections due to the complex nature of bacterial cell walls and outer membranes preventing drug entry, efflux pumps keeping the drug from reaching high intracellular concentrations, defensive enzymes such as β-lactamases destroying the drugs, and complex carbohydrate networks that create a protective capsule coating. Pyrazole moieties are found in many best selling drugs. Pyrazole-derived compounds have exhibited analgesic anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antidepressant, antimicrobial, anti-mycobacterial, anti-tumor, and antiviral activities. Additionally, fluorine substituted compounds have been very effective for a wide range of therapies. Fluorine-derived compounds notably exhibit excellent antibacterial and anticancer properties. Using this information, we were able to design several fluoro-substituted compounds that incorporating the pyrazole scaffold. These starting materials contained the reactive aldehyde functional group which serves as an effective attachment point for numerous hydrazine substituents. The research consists of 3 stages: organic synthesis of approximately 40-50 fluoro-substituted pyrazole-derived hydrazone compounds, screening of these compounds against the ESKAPE bacteria, and cytotoxicity studies of these compounds against human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells.",Omnivore,7/5/18 17:43

Complement Activation-Related Pseudoallergy (CARPA) is a major contributing factor to hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) observed after the use of nano-based therapeutics, such as liposomes. As liposomal products entered the clinic, the observed immune reactions ranged from mild to sometimes fatal with no way to predict susceptible patients.

The sheddase role of ADAMs in processing biologically decisive molecules such as amyloid precursor protein (APP), GPCR activators, cytokines such as TNF-, and growth factors, has established that dysregulation of ADAM function is detrimental to normal cell function and promotes disease. However, of the 21 human ADAMs, nearly half (8/21) inexplicably lack the consensus site required for catalysis. Despite their prevalence, the biological role of ADAMs lacking hallmark sheddase activity remains unknown. Through mutagenesis we provide the first evidence that a noncatalytic “dead” ADAM can be bestowed with catalytic activity and specificity in a manner similar to active ADAMs.  Human ADAM7 lacks only the glutamate within the active consensus site of HEXXHXXGXXH.  Introduction of this single amino acid produced protease activity that exhibit specificity like that previously reported for human ADAM28.

Because foundation species genes are strongly linked to community and ecosystem patterns and processes, restoration success is likely to be influenced by the preservation of foundation genetic variation.  Here, we exploit unanticipated consequences of a sod transfer experiment to better understand how BBS variation alters or is altered by below-ground interactions in ways that affect restoration success. Sod cut from a northwest Arkansas prairie remnant (Site 1) threatened by development was moved to a heavily disturbed agriculture site within another nearby prairie remnant (Site 2). The transfer (Site 3) was monitored for regeneration and changes in species richness and abundance. Observed changes in BBS cover prompted us to initiate a population genetic study to characterize standing-level genetic variation among the native sites (Sites 1 & 2) and to document changes in Site 3. BBS abundance was low at Site 1, accounting for ~10% cover. However, following the sod transfer, abundance increased to ~50% cover at Site 3, apparently at the expense of other species. We are currently extracting and analyzing DNA samples from all three sites in order to determine how the extent to which Sites 1 & 2 differ genetically, as well as the extent of sexual vs. asexual reproduction, is altering genetic variation of Site 3. The transfer of a thin layer of prairie to a site with decades of intense disturbance almost certainly influenced the shift in BBS abundance. If so, we have a unique opportunity to look for links between foundation species genetics and interactions with soil communities that have apparently favored BBS, and, potentially, specific BBS genotypes.

Demand for resveratrol for clinical and food use has been steadily increasing, and currently the main source of the compound is the Japanese knotweed Polygonum cuspidatum, which is an invasive species whose root system can damage building foundations, roads, and flood alleviation structures. Therefore, a more eco-friendly mode of synthesis is necessary. Microorganisms present an ideal mechanism for large-scale production of resveratrol due to the potentially high yield and low cost. To date, the efforts to synthesize resveratrol in microbial systems have largely relied upon the supplementation of other compounds involved in the biosynthetic pathway, such as p-coumaric acid and L-tyrosine. The purpose of this project is to achieve the de novo synthesis (free of large amounts of supplementation) of resveratrol by enhancing the expression of three key enzymes involved in the tyrosine-initiated pathway: tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL), 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL), and stilbene synthase (STS). To do this requires the optimization of the codons of the genes encoding TAL (from Saccarothrix espanaensis), 4CL (from Nicotiana tobacum) and STS (from Vitis vinifera). The genes for these three enzymes will be assembled into an expression plasmid pACYCDuet-1 before being transformed into E.coli BL21 DE3. The recombinant strain was be cultivated in a 2xYT-rich culture medium without the addition of other phenylpropanoids. Genomic DNA was extracted from the resulting strand and transformed into Synechocystis sp. PCC6803.

In this study, we investigated several key components for the process of cancer mutation detection with the next generation sequencing technology, including, biosample, DNA library preparation kits, sequencing alignment tool, and the combination of tumor purity, reads coverage, and mutation caller. With comparison of DNA from fresh prepared cells, we evaluated the impact of Formulin Fixed Parafin Embedded (FFPE), a protocol normally used in clinical settings for the preservation of tumor biopsy, on the reads quality. We used three kits, TruSeq, TruSeq-Nano, and Nextera, to generate DNA libraries for whole genome sequencing (WGS) and estimated the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) effect on reads quality.

D. discoideum lives as a single celled amoeba until it experiences a lack of resources, at which point the slime mold transitions into a multicellular “slug” stage. This slug senses changes in its environment and moves toward an optimal position for its survival, at which point it forms a fruiting body and reproduces. It is thought that movement of D. discoideum is largely due to cAMP waves which are themselves initiated in response to irradiation by some light source. The effects of red and blue light in association with antigravity conditions (produced by clinostat) were studied for phototaxis and subsequent location of fruiting bodies. Preliminary results indicate that red-blue light has the most significant effect on slug movement, followed by blue light, and finally red light. Results also indicate that gravity does indeed have an effect on slug motility, as slugs on clinostats showed considerably less/more random movement than controls which were stationary in normal gravitational conditions.",Omnivore,7/5/18 13:00

Systemic suppression of the immune system, specifically T-cell impairment, significantly contributes to GBM development and progression. Recent advances in cancer immunotherapies have shown great promise in alleviating such tumor-associated immunosuppression, namely programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint inhibitors. Regrettably, early clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of PD-1 inhibition in recurrent GBM have rendered only modest improvements in overall survival rates; the clinical effects of PD-L1 inhibition, however, remain poorly understood. Interestingly, a large number of independent studies have previously shown that PD-L1 is overexpressed in GBM. Furthermore, meta-analysis has recently linked PD-L1 overexpression to worse overall survival rates in GBM. Mechanistically, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, and subsequent hyper-activation, have been shown to upregulate PD-L1 gene expression in non-small cell lung cancer. Given the prevalence of EGFR amplification and mutations in GBM, we aimed to better understand whether the most frequently observed hyper-activating EGFR alteration in GBM, EGFRvIII, had any effect on PD-L1 expression levels in a human model of GBM, U87-MG. Preliminary findings from our studies indicate that EGFRvIII expression significantly elevates PD-L1 gene expression. Further studies evaluating the biological effect of PD-L1 inhibition in EGFRvIII-positive GBM are needed. Collectively, these studies will better our understanding of PD-L1 expression with regard to mutant EGFR signaling in GBM for the purpose of identifying patients who will potentially benefit from PD-L1 inhibition strategies.",Omnivore,7/5/18 14:29

If these hairpins are not destabilized or removed, these structures can lead to mutagenesis and disease. It is well known that divalent cations play important structural roles within DNA molecules, but it is not known how divalent cations stabilize hairpins formed from direct repeat tracts. The objective of this study is to understand the role that divalent metal ions play in stabilizing hairpins formed from direct repeats. DNA hairpins composed of varying sequences were titrated with Mn(2+) under a variety of ionic conditions. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to determine the concentration of Mn(2+) coordinated to DNA. The binding isotherm of Mn(2+) revealed the number and characteristics of the metal ion binding sites in DNA hairpins. The data show that hairpins containing base-base mismatches possess multiple Mn(2+) binding sites, while perfectly matched loops contain a single Mn(2+) binding site.

Within the bounds of this error, inherited clonal mutations can be identified. However, there are ultra-rare mutations which exist in cells with a frequency of less than 1% meaning that they cannot be properly identified by conventional NGS approaches. This is significant because within a patient’s body, a tumor may contain just one ultra-rare sub clonal mutation. If this mutation goes undetected by sequencing, it will also go untreated, thus allowing the mutation to further develop within the patient’s body. To address this problem, Duplex Sequencing (DS) methods have been developed by sequencing each DNA fragment multiple times within a single run. Each DNA fragment is tagged with Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI) and then duplicated by PCR. Reads with the same tags are placed into families. Each family then provides consensus sequences by comparing the nucleotides in all family members at each position. Most of the sequencing error as well as other technical errors that appear in one read and not the others can be eliminated. Likewise, mutations that have been identified with the consensus reads can be considered as confident mutations. We established a bioinformatics workflow to take over the task and applied it to a neuroblastoma dataset of 16 samples. This workflow allows us to eliminate the errors that comes with next-generation sequencing and identify ultra-rare mutations with confidence.",Omnivore,7/5/18 14:44

Onitsuka,Hendrix College,,Andrew M. Schurko,Hendrix College,,,Arkansas State University,,"Bdelloid rotifers are unique metazoans capable of recovering from DNA damage induced by high levels of ionizing radiation or desiccation. Previous transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of the bdelloid Adineta vaga revealed several genes with known biological functions, that were differentially expressed following exposure to ionizing radiation. Gene GSADVT00053952001 (henceforth named CAL) was upregulated in irradiated A. vaga, but its molecular function is unknown. The objective of this project was to investigate the function(s) of CAL in A. vaga. BLAST searches only identified CAL homologs in other bdelloids, and in some amoebozoa (protists) and plants, revealing that most eukaryotes lack CAL homologs. Next, CAL expression during DNA repair was quantified with real-time PCR. Rotifers were desiccated for one week to induce DNA damage, and were then rehydrated to stimulate DNA repair. This revealed an upregulation of CAL during rehydration, which is consistent with results from irradiated rotifers, and a role for CAL in DNA repair. We then examined the corresponding CAL protein sequence. Conserved protein domains were absent, although homologs in other species contained EF-hand calcium binding domains. To investigate the function of the CAL protein, a 6xHistidine-tagged CAL protein was used in a calcium binding assay, and also in pull down assays to identify binding partners.  Finally, we explored using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to characterize the function of CAL in A. vaga. We designed two single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that cut CAL in Cas9 cleavage assays. The sgRNAs were cloned into a plasmid containing the Cas9 gene. This was transfected into the A. vaga, and  PCR was used to detect expression of the sgRNA and Cas9 from the plasmid. While the specific function of CAL remains elusive, our gene expression, protein and genome editing approaches provide the initial steps to investigate the role of this protein in bdelloids.",Omnivore,7/5/18 15:04

Sixteen percent of the U.S. population is over 65 years of age and up to 1 out of 2 have malnutrition; therefore, seniors were chosen as subjects for the research study. Thirty subjects participated in a NFPE and completed a 24-hour diet recall. Results were calculated using Nutritionist Pro®, Excel® and SPSS®.

Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between the occurrence of Alzheimer’s and Type-2 diabetes, a disease also characterized by a rogue inflammatory response. A common link between the two is thought to be Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS-1). This protein is a key component of the insulin signaling pathway, which appears to be attenuated in both Type-2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s, resulting in a phenomenon known as “insulin resistance.” Insulin stimulates phosphorylation of IRS-1 on a tyrosine residue, but phosphorylation on serine residues is associated with insulin resistance. Elevated serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is seen in both Type-2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that Alzheimer’s may be linked to insulin resistance in the brain. 

This project explores the potential for Aβ1-42 to promote to serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 through activation of a specific kinase: Inhibitor of κB Kinase β (IKKβ). IKKβ is integral to signaling pathways that activate NFĸB, a transcription factor that activates many aspects of inflammation, including serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. A novel compound (JVM 4-25) has been generated by our drug-discovery program and appears to inhibit IKKβ in preliminary studies. We are testing the ability of JVM 4-25 to block the phosphorylation of IRS-1 stimulated by Aβ1-42. Successful completion of these studies may confirm both the mechanism of JVM 4-25 and the role of IKKβ in the inflammatory cascade by which Aβ1-42 causes insulin resistance in Alzheimer’s disease.",Omnivore,7/5/18 18:21

Primarily metabolized by the liver, terbinafine may cause hepatotoxicity due to a toxic metabolite known as TBF-A. We previously reported on the conversion of terbinafine into TBF-A from three possible N-dealkylation pathways. Those modeling and in vitro experimental studies identified desmethyl-terbinafine, as a major metabolite. In fact, after multi-dosing, desmethyl-terbinafine levels in patients are comparable to that for terbinafine. The goal of the current study is to determine the role of specific cytochrome P450 enzymes in the metabolism of desmethyl-terbinafine, and hence the variability observed in patients. As a first step, we performed inhibitor phenotyping of desmethyl-terbinafine metabolism using human liver microsomes. Those experiments showed that six P450 enzymes (2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4) were possibly involved its metabolism. We then carried out steady-state kinetic studies using recombinant forms of those enzymes to assess the efficiency of desmethyl-terbinafine metabolism for two possible reaction pathways. The first pathway leads to the formation of TBF-A and 1-napthyl methylamine, while the competing pathway yields naphthyl aldehyde and 6,6-dimethyl-2-hepten-4-yn-1-amine formation. Studies, up to now, suggest that CYP2C19 plays a key role in the former pathway due to its high efficiency in TBF-A formation and abundance in the human liver. Similarly, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 also had a high efficiency in the formation of TBF-A. CYP2C8 was more efficient in the second, competing pathway that produced naphthyl aldehyde. Knowledge of P450 enzymes responsible for the desmethyl-terbinafine metabolism will help to understand the metabolic source of and variability of TBF-A formation in patients to minimize the possibility of hepatic problems.",Omnivore,7/3/18 20:20

Abuse of these dangerous compounds is on the rise as users mistake them for the natural cannabinoid Cannabis sativa. To protect the human body, harmful compounds of exogenous and endogenous origin are metabolized by cytochrome P450s (P450s) and other drug-metabolizing enzymes. In order for doctors to properly treat these toxicities, the modes of metabolism for these compounds must be further investigated. 
My study focuses specifically on a third generation SCB, 5F-AKB-48, and its oxidation via P450s. 5F-AKB-48 was incubated with human liver microsomes (HLMs) and recombinant P450s to produce metabolites. The incubated samples were injected into an ultraviolet HPLC apparatus for spectra analysis. The resulting chromatograph peaks were compared to literature findings and mass spectometry, confirming the existence of mono-, di-, and tri-oxidated metabolites. In the next step, several recombinant enzymes were screened. The most active enzymes, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, produced the di-oxidated metabolite very effectively, followed by the tri-oxidated and mono-oxidated metabolites, respectively. Additionally, specific inhibitors of the P450s were used in the incubations with HLMs.  My preliminary data indicates that CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are the major isoforms involved in the metabolism of 5F-AKB-48. I hypothesize that many cases of toxicity result from genetic mutations leading to absences of these enzymes, and continuing experiments will aim to provide specific data on enzymatic activity.

Studies involving ABC DLBCL demonstrate a reliance on mutations in the two signaling subunits of the B-cell Receptor (BCR), CD79A and CD79B, the scaffolding protein CARD11, as well as the MYD88 signaling protein. Here, our study examines one possible therapeutic strategy for ABC DLBCL, which involves targeting DNA secondary structures in the promoter regions of these genes that are critical for ABC DLBCL cell survival. The DNA secondary structure, the G-quadruplex (G4), is characterized by a vertical stacking of guanine tetrads within a guanine-rich sequence of DNA. Recent studies suggest G4s act as transcription regulatory units, or switches, that can turn transcription on or off. We hypothesize that targeting the G4 structures within the CD79A, CD79B, CARD11, and MYD88 genes will result in a decrease of gene transcription and, by effect, constitutive signaling of the BCR. We identified G4 interactive compounds using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based high throughput screen of 1584 compounds from the NCI Diversity VI library. Subsequent FRET and spectral analysis will validate the ability of “hit” compounds to affect the stabilization of the G4 structure. Finally, we will test the effects of the discovered compounds on ABC DLBCL viability through in-vitro validation.

However, many cyanobacterial species produce toxins that can be harmful to other organisms, including humans. While studies have focused on the abiotic factors associated with cyanobacteria, such as pollution and temperature, relatively few have identified biological correlates that might be involved. However, research that includes abiotic and biotic forces are needed to truly understand the causes of harmful algal blooms (HABs). My research focuses on identifying communities of potentially interacting microbes using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) microscopy. While DNA “barcoding” via next generation DNA sequencing has provided unprecedented “windows” into microbial community composition, such studies only provide lists of species in the community. However, microbes also form spatial interactions that cannot be predicted or studied using DNA sequencing alone. New techniques using FISH microscopy provide a means for investigating the spatial distribution of interacting microbial taxa. In conjunction with DNA barcoding studies in the Woolbright lab, I am using a new FISH technique known as double-labeling of oligonucleotide probes (DOPE-FISH) to look for unanticipated spatial interactions among bacterial taxa from a variety of ecosystems (freshwater, marine, terrestrial). Understanding the spatial structure of such communities is likely to have significant impacts on our understanding of how interactions among bacteria act to structure microbial communities with implications for research on HABs as well as a variety of other community- and ecosystem-level studies.

Three days after treatment, RNA was isolated for transcriptome analysis. After RNA sequencing, differential expression analysis was ran using Tophat BOWTie2. On average 1,794 genes were differentially expressed compared to the untreated control in each experiment. The enormity of our data set required us to use pathway and meta-analysis (ipathwayguide) as a means to identify significant genes. Unique pathways were activated in both human and mouse glioblastoma groups; however, there were no similarities between their corresponding healthy serum exosomes (Hu vs NuM).

Reed,University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,,"Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is one of the most fatal cancers recorded in adults. The low survival time of patients results from high rates of tumor recurrence and resistance to chemo- and radio-therapeutic treatments. A standard-of-care treatment for GBM patients is temozolomide (TMZ), which is a DNA damage-inducing agent. Previous research has suggested that glioma cells are able to bypass TMZ-induced damage through DNA translesion synthesis (TLS).  TLS occurs through the activation of Y-family polymerases (pols). Overexpression of the Y-family member human DNA polymerase kappa (hpol κ) is characteristic in GBM and has been used as a prognostic indicator for poor outcome in glioma patients.  We hypothesize that the inhibition of hpol κ will potentiate the effects of TMZ and provide a viable method of GBM treatment. A fluorescent based screening identified PNR-7-48 as a potential inhibitor of hpol κ. To assess the combination effects of our small-molecule inhibitor on TMZ-induced damage, we measured the ability of GBM-derived T98G cells to form new colonies after treatment via clonogenic assays. We also plan to measure this combination treatment in GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) in order to see if this treatment will also target the stem population.

This variability has been often studied with respect to the clearance of warfarin’s more potent enantiomer, but still remains poorly understood.  S-Warfarin is typically the major contributor to the anticoagulant effect, yet R-warfarin and its metabolites also possess pharmacological activity and likely contribute to the overall anticoagulant response. Nevertheless, gaps remain in our understanding of metabolic pathways impacting clearance and hence levels of the metabolites.  Warfarin primarily undergoes oxidation to yield 6-, 7-, 8-, 10-, and 4’-hydroxywarfarin while its reduction into warfarin alcohols marks minor pathways.  We hypothesize that hydroxywarfarins undergo subsequent reduction to alcohols to facilitate their elimination.  We will test this hypothesis by measuring steady-state kinetics for reduction of R/S-6-, 7-, 8-, 10-, and 4’-hydroxywarfarin using human liver cytosolic fractions and then identify possible responsible enzymes through inhibitor phenotyping. In addition, analysis via mass spectrometry will be carried out on the metabolites of hydroxywarfarin reduction in vitro to confirm the production of hydroxywarfarin alcohols.  Our initial findings involve the report of the steady-state kinetics of two hydroxywarfarin alcohol reduction metabolites of 10-hydroxywarfarin. (Metabolite 1: Vmax 73.43 pmol/mg per minute, Km 0.806 mM, Metabolite 2: Vmax 221.8 pmol/mg per minute, Km 0.418 mM).

With numerous cases of NAFLD left undetected, the mechanisms and disease-specific molecular markers are of interest. The goal of our study was to investigate the role of glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Feeding a panel of inbred mice, A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ and WSB/EiJ, a choline- and folate-deficient (CFD) diet induced a strain-dependent NAFLD-like liver injury accompanied by a substantial inhibition of hepatic Gnmt expression in all mouse strains.  The Gnmt gene-specific cytosine DNA methylation was significantly higher in CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ mice, strains that exhibited a higher magnitude of NAFLD-like liver injury. Analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation in human liver HepaRG, HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 cell lines showed that HepG2 cells exhibited fewer strongly methylated (75-100%) differentially methylated regions (DMRs), higher expression of GNMT, and lower DNA methylation within the promoter region of the GNMT gene as compared to that in SK-Hep-1 cells. The knock-down of GNMT in HepG2 cells resulted in a 24% increase in the proportion of strongly methylated DMRs located in exonic, intronic, and intergenic regions. The metabolomics analysis of one-carbon metabolites showed that levels of S-adenosylmethionine, free homocysteine, and free cysteine were significantly higher in HepG2 cells transfected with GNMT siRNA. Interestingly, the protein levels of DNA methyltransferases, including DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, were unaffected. These results uncover a mechanism in which inhibition of GNMT leads to an increased pool of methyl donors that facilitate cytosine DNA methylation throughout the genome. In conclusion, epigenetically dysregulated GNMT may play a significant role in the development of NAFLD by reshaping the genomic DNA methylation profile.",Omnivore,7/5/18 11:00

While relatively simple to use, the MinION requires DNA fragments of 30 kb or more to accurately assemble a genome library. Thus, developing an optimal method for extraction of high quality and high molecular weight DNA is crucial for generating accurate data and longer reads on MinION. Extraction of high molecular weight DNA was achieved by testing and adjusting multiple extraction kits and published protocols. Based on the results, a protocol developed by Josh Quick at the University of Birmingham was used to successfully extract high molecular weight DNA from the probiotic E. coli strains G1/2 and G6/7. The DNA from G1/2 and G6/7 was loaded into a MinION flow cell, and used to assemble complete chromosomal sequences of the strains.

Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between patients with left and right-sided seizure foci on the BD test, with right-sided seizure focus related to poorer performance on this task. The other tests showed that right-sided epilepsy patients had lower scores than those with left-sided epilepsy, but they were not statistically significant. The results of the study revealed that patients with right-sided epilepsy foci performed worse than those with left-sided epilepsy foci on these measures, however, the only test that showed a statistically significant difference between seizure foci was the BD test.

This activated state is often termed neuroinflammation; however, all the causes of neuroinflammation or activation are unknown. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure is used to mimic an infection, and it causes microglia activation/neuroinflammation. We hypothesize that LPS-caused microglia activation and neuroinflammation are due in part to the adverse effects that LPS has on the brain vasculature. Adult female BALB/c mice were subcutaneously treated with 1, 2, or 3 mg/kg LPS. Acute exposure to LPS was measured 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 3d, and 14d later. Antibodies to allograft inflammatory factor (Aif1, a.k.a. Iba1) and integrin alpha (Itgam, a.k.a. Cd11b) were used to determine the presence of microglial activation. Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (Pecam1, a.k.a. Cd31) was used to visualize vasculature in the forebrain and glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP). Microglial activation was seen in the hippocampus and parietal cortex 12h, 24h, and 3d after exposure to LPS in the 2 mg/kg treatment. After 24h, the microglia were nearly all activated, with substantially larger soma and processes, and by 72h, they had diminished in size, although still activated. Additionally, the microglia were found to surround the vasculature in the LPS-treated mice. Antibodies to IgG were used to detect leakage. Some signs of vasculature and blood-brain barrier changes were produced by 2 mg/kg LPS but much greater effects of vasculature were seen after the 3 mg/kg treatment. This may result from LPS-induced hypothermia. LPS-caused microglial activation may occur through several pathways, including tight junction disruption or astrocyte end feet damage. Chemokines or cytokines released may signal microglia to surround the vasculature, Alternatively, when LPS passes through the vasculature, it may directly signal microglia through TLR4 or CD14 receptors.",Omnivore,7/5/18 10:05

The lack of early diagnostics for detecting ovarian cancer is detrimental as it kills over 14,000 women each year. The need for early diagnostic and detectable strategies are extremely prominent. Previous studies have shown that in ovarian cancer tissues the glycosyltransferase enzyme Gnt-III is over expressed and plays a role in the formation of bisecting N-linked glycans. Bisecting glycosylation also has an effect on the signaling pathway, Notch. Notch consists of epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats that undergo glycosylation which effects the binding of Notch to ligand and regulates the pathway. Past studies show that the addition of O-glucose and O-fucose stabilizes EGF repeats thus regulating Notch activity. Our goal is to study EGF repeat glycosylation on the Notch receptor in ovarian cancer. In our study, ovarian cancer cell lines with Gnt-III suppressed by shRNA and control ShRNA ovarian cancer lines are transfected with Notch 1 extracellular domain plasmids containing EGF repeats at (N1(1-36)), (N1(1-18)), and (N1(19-36)). The secreted EGF repeats will be purified and will undergo glycomic analysis to analyze the O-fucose and N-linked glycan structures using mass spectrometry.

Despite significant benefits of fMCG, its use has been limited to few research centers, largely due to significant cost in establishing and maintaining the necessary equipment. Currently, systems use Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometers which require a continuous supply of liquid helium. Small optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) has become a promising alternative with a sensitivity similar to SQUID magnetometers. In addition, OPMs entail numerous advantages over SQUIDs including low cost, sensor flexibility, and room temperature operation.

In this ongoing study, sixteen subjects between 28 weeks and 38 weeks of gestational age (GA) were recorded with a 16 OPM sensor system at 1kHz sampling rate. Data was band pass filtered between 0.5-50 Hz and notch filtered for power line attenuation. Maternal heart signals were removed using a projection operator method. Recordings were visually inspect to discard segments containing contaminated data using the Brainstorm software. Fetal R peak markers were detected and manually corrected. We successfully obtained 34 datasets containing high amplitude (1101±383 fT) that was possible to detect fetal R peaks. We obtained fetal heart rates of 145.85±20.70 bpm and R-R intervals of 427.69±24.64 msec which is in the range of previous studies with SQUID magnetometers (~150bpm, ~423 msec).

Among most AD patients, 75-80% of them show CAA. CAA occurs because of deposition of plaques in the microvessels, a key component of neurovascular units (NVU). These endothelial cells are surrounded by pericytes, another component of NVU. Pericytes regulate blood flow in the brain and provide support to the microvessels and eliminate toxic molecules from the brain by an efflux mechanism. In this study, we evaluated the role of pericytes in a mouse model of CAA which shows Aβ deposition in the vessels in addition to parenchyma. To visualize pericytes in the brain, Fluoro-Ruby (FR)-dextran, a retrograde tracer was injected bilaterally into lateral ventricles of mouse brains.  In addition, CD31 immunolabeling was performed to evaluate the integrity of the endothelial cells of the brain. Fluoro Jade C labeling was also done to evaluate neurodegeneration in the brain. FR labeled pericytes were dystrophic in nature in the CAA mice compared to their wild type counterparts. The results also showed that compared to the wild type, there was a higher number of pericytes in the cortex but fewer pericytes in the hippocampus of the CAA mice. Most FJC labeled axonal degeneration was prevalent in the hippocampus with a moderate amount in the cortex. While the number of endothelial cells were increased in the CAA mice compared to wild type mice; the area fraction and intensity of the endothelial cells in the brain of the CAA mice were significantly less than that found in the wild type. These findings suggest degeneration of the pericytes and endothelial cells and ischemia of the vessels resulting from deposition of Aβ plaque deposition in the microvasculature of the brain and CAA could also cause axonal degeneration.",Gluten Free,6/20/18 12:57

The complement system activates when antigen-antibody aggregates stimulate a component of the protein complex known as C1. C1q is one of three proteins that form the structure of C1. During pregnancy, C1q levels directly affect the health and development of the fetus. Also, C1q is an influential factor in nervous system development and it even possesses anti-cancerous properties (Kouser et al. 2015). Due to its structural similarity to collagen and its bundle-like quaternary structure C1q could be a useful model to study trans-collagen binding. Bacterial collagenases can contain a variable number of collagen binding domains. When infecting host tissue, collagenases with multiple domains may be able to anchor to separate collagen molecules, thus trans, and then begin collagenolysis. My research incorporates different experimental procedures to isolate and purify C1q from bovine blood. Bovine blood was clotted and converted into serum. The protein complex containing C1q was precipitated using Euglobulin Precipitation. Centrifugations and dialysis were used along with certain buffer solution to purify and maintain ideal conditions for c1q extraction. Ion exchange chromatography using DEAE gel was also used as an important step in the purification of the sample. UV spectroscopy, SDS PAGE and BCA assay where used to measure protein concentration and identify presence of C1q. Non-reducing- SDS PAGE resulted in bands within the range of 440 kDa and reducing -SDS PAGE gels produced bands with 100-200 kDa ranges. These results are consistent with the distinctive presence of C1q. C1q was isolated with impurities present in solution from bovine sample.

Identification of specific biomarkers through genome scanning can provide information on adverse drug reaction or drug-response phenotypes in a specific drug’s administration. The field of pharmacogenomics has expanded over the last decade, but comprehensive data is not yet available. Additionally, studies on specific ethnic biomarkers have been lacking. The purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive study of pharmacogenomics biomarkers in minority groups such as African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics using FDA approved drug labeling and a comprehensive literature survey. The most updated CDER table from FDALabel was used to more accurately identify drugs with predetermined biomarkers. Each drug’s FDA label was found through DailyMed and published literature through PubMed. Data on 58 and 62 drugs were found on African American and Asian biomarkers respectively, while only 7 were found on Hispanic biomarkers. Also, the cytochrome P-450 biomarkers, such as CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, had a significantly larger amount of published data and information when compared to other biomarkers, as 52 out of the 99 drugs had biomarkers from the CYP family. These findings suggest that further studies should be conducted to expand the specific genetic biomarker understanding of lesser represented ethnic groups, particularly in the Hispanic group, in response to certain FDA approved drugs. This information could assist in the integration of pharmacogenomics into clinical practice in the future.",Omnivore,7/5/18 13:04

Foley,National Center for Toxicological Research,,Bijay K. Khajanchi,National Center for Toxicological Research,,"Salmonella enterica is a prominent foodborne pathogen around the globe. Plasmids containing antimicrobial resistance and iron acquisition related genes have been found to reside within Salmonella strains. Both of these characteristics are found on plasmids of the incompatibility group FIB (IncFIB) and may play a role in the virulence potential of the strains they inhabit. In this study we assessed the virulence potential of a group of Schwarzengrund strains, some of which contained IncFIB plasmids.
19 Schwarzengrund food isolates with sequences on Plasmidfinder and ResFinder analyses were obtained. Nine of the strains contained the IncFIB plasmids with resistance to streptomycin. IncFIB plasmid presence was further confirmed by plasmid replicon typing PCR. Invasion and persistence assays using human intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) were performed to assess virulence. Invasion and persistence were determined 1 h and 48 h after the infection of Caco-2 cells with Schwarzendgrund strains. Conjugation experiments were performed to transfer IncFIB plasmids from Schwarzengrund strains to Escherichia coli and Salmonella recipient strains.
Nine isolates were positive for IncFIB replicon typing PCR that matched with PlasmidFinder data. All Schwarzengrund isolates were able to invade Caco-2 cells. Bacterial counts were higher in a majority of the isolates at 1 h (Invasion) as compared to 48 h (Persistence) post infection. Three strains showed increased persistence compared to invasion. Three isolates showed much higher levels of invasion than the rest and two of those showed increased persistence. Overall invasion rates ranged from 1 to 10% of the bacteria used to infect the cells while persistence levels fell within 0.1-0.5%. 7 out of 9 of the IncFIB plasmids were able to transfer from Schwarzengrund strains into the recipient E. coli J53. This study is useful in providing a framework to assess the effects of plasmid encoded factors on virulence in S. Schwarzengrund.",Herbivore (Vegetarian),7/5/18 15:02

While circulating blood platelets are well-characterized for their contributions to coagulation, increasingly platelet-dependent effects on inflammation are being recognized.  Here, we focus on the platelet membrane receptor, glycoprotein VI (GPVI), and its role in platelet microparticle (pMP) release.  The GPVI receptor is a platelet-specific collagen membrane receptor that, upon ligand binding, facilitates the release of pMPs.  As membrane-bound platelet fragments of less than 1 micron, pMPs are known to have both proinflammatory and procoagulagnt properties.  Our laboratory has previously generated and characterized a mouse model of GPVI deficiency – a GPVI knockout mouse.  A consequence of murine GPVI deficiency is reduced levels of circulating pMPs.  Our experiments have focused on performing a murine model of GPVI sepsis, termed Cecal-Ligation and Puncture (CLP).  CLP surgery produces a systemic inflammatory response and polymicrobial sepsis response due to intestinal bacteria being released into the peritoneal space.  Our ongoing studies are characterizing the phenotype response of GPVI knockout animals as compared to a wild-type, or normal, mouse cohort.  Animals of similar age and sex form the 2 groups for comparison.  Our aim is to further understand the relevance of circulating blood platelets in the complex pathophysiological responses that occur in sepsis.  Using the information for improved therapies, patient management, and patient outcomes is an obvious long term objective.",Herbivore (Vegetarian),7/5/18 10:35
