S. enterica strains harbor a number of incompatibility group (Inc) plasmids including IncFIB. IncFIB contains important genes that contribute to bacteria’s iron acquisition ability, which allows the bacteria to better persist in animal and human hosts. In this study, we aimed to determine how iron-rich (IR) and various iron-depleted (ID) conditions affect the transcription of iron acquisition and virulence genes including sitA, iutA, iucA, and enolase at different time intervals.
S. enterica wild type SE163A and a transconjugant (SE819:IncFIB) were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) IR and LBID broth for 2, 4, and 18 hours. Ferric chloride (100µM) and bipyridyl (200µM) were added to LB broth to prepare IR and ID media, respectively. Both strains were also incubated in LBID conditions by supplementing different concentration of bipyridyl including 100, 50, 25, and 5 µM for 4 hours. Total RNA was isolated and purified from two biological replicates from each strain. cDNA was synthesized for each RNA sample and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using SYBR green assays were performed to determine gene expression. The primers were specifically designed to only detect the sitA, iutA, iucA, and enolase genes located in IncFIB.
All 4 genes that were grown in LBID conditions were substantially upregulated when compared to LBIR conditions. For both S. enterica strains that were grown at various LBID conditions, the 200 µM of bipyridyl had the highest transcription for all four genes and then the100 µM concentration. The other concentrations did not show any significant differences when compared to each other. Our study shows how iron-depleted conditions increase the transcription of the iron acquisition systems located in IncFIB plasmids which allows us to better understand the role of plasmid factors in the pathogenesis of Salmonella.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heteroscorpionate variants of this chelate-class exhibit unique asymmetry in metal-complexes. The ligand Tp’ was created in our lab (Inorg.

The present work describes Fe(Tp’)2, a deep orange iron(II) form, whose structure of its cis-Fe(Tp’)2 isomer was confirmed by single crystal XRD. An array of methods characterized these complexes, including paramagnetic 11B NMR, Infrared, MALDI, and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The iron(II) form is characterized by unique intense MLCT in the visible region; this MLCT is red shifted in the deep purple iron(III) form. Collectively, our lab has shown M(Tp’)2 to be applicable across a range of first-row transition metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). The iron(II) form also shows interesting spin-crossover (SCO, high spin/low spin equilibrium) at room temperature. Nominal HS/LS switching temperatures are unusual and increase the applicability of our compound class to more mainstream applications. Thermochemical Keq and enthalpies were determined for this SCO equilibrium. Detailed descriptions of this tunable magnetic behavior of Fe(Tp’)2 can inform efforts to use less expensive metal ions like iron for biomedical (MRI contrast agents) and high tech applications (cell phone speakers, hybrid-electric motors) that frequently rely on far more expensive and toxic rare earth metals.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Duina",Hendrix College,,,Arkansas State University,,"To promote transcription elongation, the Facilitates Chromatin Transactions (FACT) complex, composed of the Spt16 and Pob3 proteins in yeast, works in parallel with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) by facilitating the disassembling and reassembling of nucleosomes while moving toward the 3' end of genes. In previous studies from our laboratory using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae model system, we identified a region on the side of the nucleosome, which we refer to as the ISGI (Influences Spt16-Gene Interactions) region, that is required for proper dissociation of FACT from the 3' ends of transcribed genes.  To further investigate the mechanisms that control FACT dissociation from genes, we are carrying out two mass spec-based approaches to compare the chromatin environments at 3’ ends of genes between wild-type and ISGI-mutant cells.  In the first approach, we are assaying 3’ ends of all genes by affinity purification of chromatin fragments using Rtt103, a general transcription termination factor.  For the second approach, we are characterizing the 3’ end of a single gene (GAL2) using the CRISPR-ChAP-MS methodology developed by Alan Tackett’s laboratory at UAMS.  Any differences in chromatin environments uncovered in these experiments could identify proteins or histone modifications that are normally required for Spt16 dissociation from genes.  Candidate proteins or histone modifications will be subsequently tested directly for roles in promoting Spt16-gene dissociation.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marecki,University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,,Kevin D. Raney,University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 (scPif1) is a prototypical member of the Pif1 helicase family plays multiple vital roles in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA metabolism, such as effectively unwinding quadruplex DNA structures, maintaining telomeric DNA and reducing processivity of telomerase among other functions. Recent studies demonstrate that targeting the human enzyme is important in cancer therapy. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of scPif1 helicase can help produced better therapeutic agents. In this study, we propose that amino acid in the protein-protein interaction domain is critical for enzyme function, and by mutating the glutamine to an alanine will results in altered enzyme activities including its affinity for DNA, ATPase activity and ability to unwind DNA structures. The glutamine at position 674 in scPif1 was mutated to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (scPif1-E674A) and cloned into the pSUMO vector for over-expression in Escherichia coli. Using affinity chromatography and FPLC, the wild-type and mutant scPIF1proteins were purified to approximately 95% purity.  The helicase activity of scPif1 requires the hydrolysis of ATP; therefore, we assayed the DNA-dependant ATPase activities of both the recombinant wild-type and mutant scPif1. We found that scPif1-E674A has a higher enzyme activity compared to the ScPif1 wild type. We will further characterize scPif1-E674A with the DNA binding assay using single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to determine how well scPif1-E674A interacts with DNA.
Additionally, we will utilize DNA unwinding assays to determine its ability to unwind DNA substrates in a manner similar to the wild type enzyme. Initially, we can conclude that scPif1-E674A helicase can be purified and has higher ATPase activity. These further studies will probe more deeply into the helicase activity to assist in determining the possible importance of protein-protein interactions on the DNA- and ATP-dependent activity of Pif1.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the leading cause of death is respiratory failure. It is estimated that at least 20,000 Americans suffer from this disease. This disease is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes which encodes type I collagen or by autosomal recessive mutations in e.g. cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) affecting post-translational modifications (PTM). Disruption of proper function of CRTAP is known to be the responsible of OI type VII. Prolyl 3-hydroxylation is essential for translation of 3-hydroxyproline to type I collagen. Prolyl-3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) forms a complex with CRTAP and cyclophilin B (CyPB) acting as a chaperone to 3-hydroxylate the proline residue. Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a collagen containing lectin that helps with lung immunity and homeostasis. It is necessary to study if SP-D is affected by these PTM’s because it contains a collagen like structure. SP-D cannot be obtained easily in vivo since the quantity extraction available from mice lungs is not significant. Therefore, expression in vitro is necessary. Two plasmids are being used pCMV-DDK-C and pLenCMV containing SP-D sequence to transfect epithelial type II cell lines. Two cell lines will be used, A549 and A549 CRTAP k/o. First using A549, we will determine if the expression concentration of the SP-D is significant and if it is found intracellular or extracellular. We will analyze the PTM’s of SP-D by Flow Cytometry.

Wide use of nanomaterials may eventually lead to environmental poisoning including the contamination of food. However, methods for the assessment of nanomaterial toxicity are not well developed. The current study was aimed at the development of techniques to measure toxicity of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in vivo. For this, male CD-1 mice were fed by oral gavage with water suspension of MWCNTs at varying doses up to 10 mg/kg/day. Twenty-four hours later, blood chemistry testing showed elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), a liver injury marker, at the highest used dose. The liver damage was confirmed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Our further analysis included the application of dark-field microscopy (DFM) for (a) the colocalization between MWCNTs and TUNEL-positive cells and (b) development of a method to quantify MWCNTs burden in liver tissue. DFM clearly showed some elevation of particulate material in the liver with occasional association with TUNEL-positive cells. DFM did not allow visualization of individual nanoparticles even at the highest magnification, and quantification of nanoparticle aggregates was not reliable due to low sensitivity of DFM at the concentration observed in the liver. Our unexpected finding was that MWCNT concentration in liver tissue could be measured instead by the decrease of mean light intensity in DFM. Increased MWCNT concentration had a direct, negative, linear correlation with mean light intensity, apparently measuring both visible aggregates and invisible particles. This DFM-based technique may become an inexpensive and precise method to determine nanoparticle burden in tissues for the purpose of toxicology assessment.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Caenorhabditis elegans (C.elegans) is a free-living nematode that has conserved cell signaling pathways that are extremely similar to humans.  They have a short median life span of 18-20 days and a life cycle of 2.5 days and are an excellent model organism and were used in this project.  Mutant strain of C.elegans strain that has a particular mutation in the kinase domain of phosphotidyl inositol 3- kinase (PI3K, strain name mg44) was found to have a ten-fold extension to its lifespan.  We sequenced the mRNA species of the mutant and compared to wild-type organism, these mutant animals have different expression of genes.   The genes that are down regulated in longevity organism are the main focus of the project. We decided to knockdown the genes that are upregulated in wild type compared to mutant in wild-type C. elegans.  This project focuses on the effects of different RNAi bacteria on decreasing gene expression in down-regulated genes in normal C.elegans strains and seeing how that affects protein aggregation. The results could help find potential ways to lower the amount of deleterious age-associated protein aggregation.  Knock down of these genes had a negative effect on the protein aggregation for 29 of the 30 genes tested.  Only one gene decreased the aggregation. The results suggest that protein aggregation is not always associated with genes that influence life span and combination of genes are needed to impact the effects observed in long-lived mutants.

The DRG contain the cell bodies of a collection of sensory neurons that include nociceptors; the neurons that sense painful stimuli. In order to understand how the correct number of nociceptors are formed in the DRG during embryonic development, this study attempts to characterize part of the gene regulatory network that is required to generate these cells. One key gene that is involved in this network is the transcription factor neurogenin1 (neurog1). Neurog1 is expressed by progenitor cells in the DRG and this gene is required for the generation of nociceptors since knockout mice that lack the neurog1 gene do not produce nociceptive neurons. Because neurog1 is a transcription factor, we hypothesize that it is a key node in the gene regulatory network that produces nociceptors and that transcriptional targets of the neurog1 gene are also members of this network. To identify transcriptional targets of the neurog1 gene, we have compared the transcriptome of embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) cervical dorsal root ganglia from wild-type and neurog1 knockout embryos. Differential gene expression analysis has identified several genes that appear to be downregulated in the knockout and therefore are potential transcriptional targets of the neurog1 gene. To confirm the differential expression of the genes identified in the transcriptome analysis, we are currently examining their mRNA expression pattern in the cervical DRG of wild-type and neurog1 knockout E11.5 embryos by in situ hybridization with complementary RNA probes. The results of this comparative analysis will be presented.

In E. coli, MutS initiates DNA mismatch repair via binding to the DNA mismatch. Once bound, MutS uses its ATPase activities to signal for other repair proteins to excise and correct the mismatch. MutS has been shown to have a higher binding affinity to G-T, A-C, G-G, and A-A mismatches when compared to other mismatches, C-T, A-G, T-T, and C-C, which bind at a lower affinity. Spectrophotometric ATPase assays were used to measure the ATPase activity of MutS in the presence of all eight possible DNA mismatches. From spectrophotometric ATPase assay data, a kcat value can be found that characterizes ATP reactions with MutS. Fluorescence anisotropy was used to test the binding activity of MutS by the discovery of a Kd value, which is the measurement of the protein’s binding affinity. Details like ATPase activity and binding affinity are important to understanding more about how DNA mismatch recognition works on a molecular level. Because the DNA mismatch repair system is conserved throughout nature, the DNA mismatch repair pathway of E. coli serves as a prototype for understanding DNA mismatch repair in humans. In addition, the mechanism for specific molecular recognition and signaling may be conserved across DNA metabolic pathways.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the identification of indication description is mostly achieved through human annotations, which is time-consuming and label intensive. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based sentiment analysis for indication description extraction. First, we curated a benchmark drug indication information pool consisting of 7745 sentences (4076 indication description sentences and 3669 negative control sentences) from “Indications and Usage Section” in 36108 FDA approved prescription labeling documents. Second, the biomedical-based word embeddings were developed by employing whole FDA approved drug labeling documents using word2vec. Third, a deep learning-based sentiment analysis was implemented for distinguishing the positive and negative indication description sentences using word2vec-based word embeddings with a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Finally, we evaluated the model performance with a 50-time Monte Carlo cross validation (MCCV) and external indication resources including Wiki-drug, RxList, and clinicaltrial.gov, which generated a promising performance comparable to state-of-art methodologies.

Prolonged or widespread stalling of the replisome leaves DNA vulnerable to catastrophic damage. Consequently, cancer cells activate mechanisms, such as translesion synthesis (TLS), that can resolve replication intermediates arising from stress at the fork. TLS requires the action of Y-family DNA polymerases that are able to bypass DNA lesions. TLS polymerase kappa (pol κ) plays a vital role in bypassing certain barriers to fork progression, as well as in the protection of stalled forks from degradation by nucleases. Previous studies have implicated pol κ in the resolution of fork stress in cancers like glioblastoma, but the role of pol κ in breast cancer (BrCa) has yet to be established. BRCA1 mutated BrCa cells are homologous recombination deficient (HRD), which makes these cells more reliant on alternative RSR mechanisms for survival. We hypothesize that pol κ acts as a barrier to DNA replication catastrophe, genomic instability, and cell death in BrCa cells and that this role is amplified in HRD BrCa. We will evaluate the importance of pol κ to genome maintenance in BrCa by measuring changes in replication fork dynamics, genome stability/DNA damage formation, and proliferation/viability due to pharmacological inhibition or CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knock-out of pol κ in both BRCA1 WT and BRCA1 mutant BrCa cell lines. We predict that pol κ loss will increase replication defects and BrCa cell sensitivity to genotoxic agents, especially in BRCA1 mutant cells. Additionally, we expect pol κ depletion in BRCA1-deficient cells to cause chromosomal instability in response to Wee1 checkpoint inhibition. Completion of this study will improve our understanding of the RSR in BrCa and may help us develop new strategies to increase breast cancer treatment success.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The formulation for producing ND alters the biophysical and biochemical properties of ND in comparison to the same drugs in their traditional micro-sized form. As a result, we expect to see variation in the reactivity of ND in the intestinal tissue. We tested our hypothesis using formulated Zileuton ND (poorly soluble BCS-II drug) to evaluate intestinal permeability and assess the immunotoxicity of ND. Human intestinal tissues (ileum and colon) were obtained from CHTN network. Biopsy punches of intestinal tissues were incubated with ND, physical mixture (Zileuton, Sucralose, Kollidon and DowfaxA21), or Kollidon in a 24 transwell plate for 24 hours at increasing concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 µg/ml). Tissue was homogenized to isolate RNA and proteins. Cytokines levels were measured using a 48-plex cytokine kit obtained from Bio-Rad. The cytokine data revealed that Zileuton ND decreases IL-5 secretion only in ileal tissue at low concentrations. The results also revealed that 0.1 µg/ml and 1µg/ml treated ileal tissue exhibited higher levels of several proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, HGF, Eotoxin, NGF and IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha) compared to 1000 µg/ml treated tissue of ND. In contrast, few cytokine levels were higher only at higher ND concentrations. A detailed profile for intestinal permeability related gene expression will also be discussed in detail.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Burke,NCTR,,Mark E. Hart,NCTR,,,Arkansas State University,,"Staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive bacterium, is primarily the etiologic agent for menstrual toxic shock syndrome (TSS), an infection that is often associated with the menstrual cycle of women and especially those who use tampons with high absorbency.  Toxic shock syndrome is an example of a condition resulting from toxemia caused by S. aureus that is facilitated primarily by toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1).  TSST-1 is a superantigen promoting an exaggerated response by the human immune system and can potentially lead to septic shock and death.
Antibiotic resistance in S. aureus remains a major concern thus, it is important to understand the environmental conditions that are conducive for growth and toxin production of S. aureus during the course of a menstrual cycle.  In an effort to simulate the conditions of menstruation and evaluate the growth behavior of S. aureus, two prototypic TSS-causing S. aureus strains, MN8 and FRI-1169, were grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB) enriched with 36% porcine blood.  Growth was analyzed by viable cell count in 2-hour increments for the first 12 hours and every 24 hours up to seven days thereafter. These cell counts were then compared to the cell counts of S. aureus grown in TSB alone.  The data revealed an altered growth pattern for both MN8 and FRI-1169 in TSB containing blood in comparison to growth in TSB alone.  Strains MN8 and FRI-1169 exhibited a 10- and 100-fold decline, respectively, in viability within the first two hours when grown in the presence of blood. The strains were then able to recover to levels comparable to growth in TSB alone.  Currently, experiments are being conducted to determine if the production of virulence factors, specifically TSST-1, are affected when S. aureus is grown in blood.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perceived motor skill competency plays an important role in physical activity levels of children and adolescents. Perceived motor skill competency is related to lower levels of physical activity, which can further limit the ability to develop motor skills. The goal of this study was to determine if perceived motor skill competency at ages three through five relate to the ability of children to develop locomotor and object control skills regardless of amount of physical education experience. Physical education was provided to 102 children (ages three through five) at one of three levels, five days per week, three days per week, or no intervention. All students completed a perceived motor skill competency assessment and Test of Gross Motor Development (TGMD) before starting the intervention. After the intervention students completed a second TGMD. A significant relationship was found between the amount of physical education intervention time received and the ability to develop object control (F= 3.38, P < 0.05, η2 = 0.09) and locomotor skills (F= 16.68, P < 0.05, η2 = 0.33).  No significant relationship was found between perceived motor skill competency and object control and locomotor skills. Findings suggest that early physical education intervention can facilitate development of locomotor and object control skills in children despite potential negative effects of low perceived motor skill competence scores.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metabolic testing and phylogenetic analysis via 16S rRNA gene sequencing suggests that SORT-26 is a novel, antibiotic-producing strain of the Gram-negative bacterium Alcaligenes faecalis. Whole genome sequencing conducted using Pacific Biosciences long-read technology and assembled at MOgene produced a 4,083,727 bp genome in a single contig, while the taxonomic threshold program JSpecies indicated average nucleotide identity (ANIm) values from 86.7% to 89.58% against the most similar Alcaligenes faecalis genomes, suggesting that SORT-26 is a previously-unreported strain of this species.

Simmen,University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third ranked cause of cancer-associated deaths in the United States.  CRC is characterized by metabolic and redox pathway dysregulation within tumors.  Our goal was to investigate a potential metabolic and redox pathway involving Malic Enzyme 1 (ME1) coupled to one or more members of the NOX/DUOX family.  ME1 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of S-malate to pyruvate and generates reduced NADP (NADPH) used, in part, for lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis.  We hypothesized that cytosolic NADPH generated by ME1 is also used by the NOX/DUOX family of proteins to generate increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the latter then promoting growth of intestinal tumors.  Our laboratory previously developed a new mouse model of intestinal cancer by crossing mice overexpressing ME1 in the intestinal mucosa (ME1-Tg mice) with ApcMin/+ mice that bear a mutation in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (Apc) gene.  We found an increase in number and size of intestinal tumors in ApcMin/+/ME1-Tg mice, compared to ApcMin/+ littermates.  In the present work, small and large intestines from these same mice were subject to immunohistochemistry (IHC) for NOX1, NOX4 and DUOX2 (three members of the NOX/DUOX protein family hypothesized to be highly expressed in normal intestines and their tumors).  Adenomas were highlighted by IHC for β-catenin.  IHC for NOX1 revealed staining in the uppermost regions of the villi of the normal appearing intestinal mucosa. NOX4 IHC stained the smooth muscle layers of the small intestines.  Neither NOX1 nor NOX4 IHC preferentially stained the adenomas.  DUOX2 IHC signal, in contrast, was localized to the proliferative cells of the crypts, and in the submucosa and adenomas (sporadic staining).  The data suggest physiological roles for NOX1, NOX4 and DUOX2 in intestinal physiology, and support a possible linkage of ME1 and DUOX2 in redox regulation of intestinal adenoma growth.

The purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of a nutrition and physical activity intervention in improving the BMI-for-age percentiles of rural Arkansas children at risk for childhood obesity. The study consisted of a treatment group (n=94) and a control group (n=35) of children 3-12 years of age. Anthropometric data for each child in the control and the treatment group was collected at the beginning and end of the seven-week intervention. Data was used to calculate BMI, BMI-for-age percentile, weight status category, and BMI z-scores. The researchers visited the treatment group weekly and taught 30-60 minute lessons on nutrition and physical activity. The control group did not receive treatment.

Hubbard, PhD",Ouachita Baptist University,,,Arkansas State University,,"Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a chemical found in hard plastics. BPA is an endocrine disruptor as it binds to estrogen receptors. This is linked to negative health effects such as cardiovascular disease and developmental issues. Infants and young children are more at risk to these effects because their endocrine systems are not fully developed. For this project, toothbrushes were investigated to determine if they contained BPA. BPA is a fluorescent compound with an excitation wavelength of 278 nm and an emission wavelength of 304 nm, so a FS-5 spectrofluorometer from Edinburgh Instruments was used to determine the presence of  BPA in each sample. 
	Each toothbrush was placed in 100 mL of a 1:1 methanol:water solution at room temperature. A 5-mL aliquot of the solution was taken at time intervals ranging from 5 minutes to 1 week after the toothbrush was placed in the solution. Each sample was run in the spectrofluorometer in duplicate, where the emission and excitation intensities were reviewed and recorded. These values were compared to a BPA calibration curve in order to determine the concentration of BPA leached into the solution from the toothbrushes. 
After determining which toothbrushes had traces of BPA, a similar method was utilized to investigate where the bulk of the BPA was located within the toothbrush. The bristles were removed from the BPA-containing toothbrushes. The bristles and the head of each toothbrush were then placed separately into 100-mL solutions of 1:1 methanol:water and analyzed following the protocol described above.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other than in the skin, this cancer can also develop in the eyes and in internal organs such as the intestines. The risk of melanoma is higher in people under 40, especially in Caucasian women. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the leading cause of melanoma. The cost of treating of newly diagnosed melanomas is expected to increase from $457 million in 2011 to $1.6 billion in 2030. Development of new therapeutic options are urgently needed to treat this rapidly rising malignancy. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that synthesis and anti-melanoma studies of novel thiazole-androstenone derivatives will lead to the discovery of potent anti-melanoma agents. Reduction of thiazole-androstenone derivative corresponding alcohol lead to the formation of ~30 novel compounds. These molecules have been tested against NCI-60 cancer cell lines. Several of these molecules have shown potent activity against several cell lines including many cell lines of melanoma panel at submicromolar concentration.

While electrospinning biopolymers may be a challenge, due to their inconsistent rheological and gelling behaviors, the resulting nanofibrous webs could act as a platform for biomedical applications. The incorporation of biomimetic polymers into nanofibrous dressing using synthetic biomolecule analogs will reduce the costs associated with the traditionally used biopolymers. The biomimetic molecules in the nanofibrous dressing will also be capable of mimicking both structure and morphology of the body’s native extracellular matrix, which can facilitate the natural wound healing process in the human body. 
The purpose of our research was to develop a collagen strand analog from poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) via the coupling of functional groups to the carboxylic residues of PAA. The selected functional groups represent the major amino acids present in collagen. The resulting biomimic was analyzed by ¬1H NMR spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy to verify the attachment of each functional group to the PAA backbone.

Approximately 30% of epilepsy patients experience pharmacoresistance to seizure medication and some are then evaluated for resection surgery. Stereo electroencephalography (sEEG) is a neuroimaging modality used for presurgical examination that utilizes intracranial depth electrodes to localize the epileptic focus. The relationship between electrical oscillations can be measured by phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), a technique in which the phase of the low frequency oscillations modulates the amplitude of the high frequency oscillations.  Studies have shown that PAC plays an important role in mechanisms of communication and connectivity in neural networks. Recently, PAC has been used to determine the predictive accuracy of seizure onset sites and eloquent areas. This study used sEEG recordings of epilepsy patients to characterize and compare PAC of the pre- and post-ictal states and seizure periods in clinical and subclinical seizures. Twenty-three clinical and six subclinical seizures, were obtained from eight epileptic patients. We applied signal-processing techniques to clean the selected data segments, then PAC was computed from four pairs of frequency settings. The Kruskal-Wallis procedure was performed for statistical comparisons. Overall, PAC strengths significantly increased in seizure epochs and decreased in pre- and post-ictal states in all clinical seizures.  Same significance patterns were not observed in the subclinical seizures.  PACs between theta and gamma oscillations in the seizure period were higher in comparison with pre- and post-ictal segments in clinical seizures.  Nested frequencies increased in post-ictal periods compare to seizure epochs at epileptic focus channels (SOZ) in clinical seizures between low (delta, theta) and high gamma oscillations.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the major limitations of stroke treatment is the timeliness by which care is administered. Furthermore, there are a limited number of treatments for stroke, none of which are truly effective at regenerating damaged brain tissue. The recent rise in popularity of the bottom up approach to neuroscience coincides with the desire to model functional components of the brain in vitro in order to better understand processing of information. The following project proposes a method for directing neural stem cell growth utilizing an anti-fouling coating, UV light, and simple wash steps using methanol and water. For this particular research project, a variety of different proteins, polymers, and anti-fouling agents were combined in order to identify which combination yields the greatest directional control and cell viability. The hypothesis for this specific project is that a mixture of PAAm-g-PFPA (poly(allyl amine) grafted to perfluorophenyl azide), beta-NGF, and PVP (Poly (vinylpyrrolidone)) will yield the greatest cell viability and directional control of Schwann cells. The amines in PAAm will allow for the adhesion promoter to bind to the well plate. The azide in PFPA will allow for cross linking with the desired protein/polymer of interest (Beta-NGF) upon exposure to UV light. PVP will serve as the antifouling agent that will prevent cell growth wherever present. When combined, PAAm-g-PFPA, Beta-NGF, and PVP allowed cells to attach to specific portions of the well plate which yielded controlled cell growth. Through this project we hope to increase accessibility to in vitro neural cell networks in order to advance understanding of neurodegenerative diseases as well as experiment with possible drugs in the treatment of said diseases such as stroke and Huntington's.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This project explored gliovascular development in a transgenic rat model (Tg) to characterize the neural response to AD pathogenesis. We predicted proliferation of astrocytic activity at older ages, corresponding with augmented immune responses to AD progression. Here, a transgenic rat model (Tg) was used that overexpressed the mutated genes responsible for familial AD; double-labeling with Lycopersicon esculentum Lectin and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein allowed examination of the gliovasculature of brain tissues of these animals. Control rats demonstrated healthy vasculature, with negligible astrocytic activation at all ages examined. At 6 months in the Tg group, cortical astrocytic activity was minimal, while hippocampal astrocytic activity was notable in regions containing plaques intertwined with vessels. At 9 months in the Tg group, astrocytic activity augmented in both regions, with extended astrocytic endfeet localized around vessels and plaques. Within this age group, neurovasculature deteriorated, indicated by thinned and torn vessels in the hippocampus and cortex. At 16 months of age, astrocytic activity proliferated throughout cortical and hippocampal regions in the Tg group, corresponding to areas near toxic Aβ plaque deposits. Vessels in this age group showed the most degeneration of all Tg groups, indicating progressive ischemic qualities of neurovasculature in the regions affected by AD pathology. Overall, these findings indicate a direct relationship between the temporal progression of the disease and stimulated astrocytic astrocytic activity which affects vasculature in areas most affected by AD pathology.",Gluten Free,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, it is responsible for proper disjunction of homologous chromosomes from each other at the first division and second, it produces genetic diversity in the resulting gametes. Homologous recombination occurs more frequently at specific DNA sequence motifs known as hotspots.  Understanding the mechanisms controlling hotspot recombination is important as errors in the positioning and frequency of recombination events can give rise to aneuploidy, which is the leading cause of miscarriages and birth defects.  Using nucleosome scanning assays in the model organism Schizosaccharomyces pombe, our laboratory showed that chromatin remodeling occurs at five different hotspot motifs but not at a corresponding control.  By combining a mass spectrometry approach with classical genetics, we identified proteins involved in this process at the well-studied hotspot ade6-M26. This current research focuses on whether these proteins are also required at four additional hotspots that have been placed in the same genomic location.

In a person with Alzheimer’s disease toxic changes in the brain are caused by buildup of beta-amyloid and tau protein. The accumulation of tau forms tangles inside neurons and beta-amyloid forms plaques in between neurons. Both tangles and plaques weaken the neuronal communication and causes dementia, impaired decision making, and language problems. Other changes such as lack in glucose also affects the brain. My project is related to the modulation of neurotransmitter receptors by insulin-like growth factors. Insulin works like a neuromodulator in the brain compared to regulator of a glucose as in the rest of the body.  Rapid effects of insulin elevate the activity of glutamate receptors. Ion channels in the cell membrane are opened when the glutamate receptors are activated which permits calcium influx into the neuron and the calcium levels are measured using fluorescent calcium measurement. Insulin-like growth factor-2 is a protein that seems to increase calcium levels in hippocampal cells in 2-3 minutes, but it tends to have the opposite effects in cortical cells.  GluR1 is a membrane protein that belongs to the glutamate-gated ion channel and is used to determine the amount of activation of the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate.  The experiments conducted with these specific conditions are still in progress and results will be concluded in the future. NT2 cell line which are known as cancer cells are also being used in our project. The main goal from that cell line is to see amount of GluR1 protein present in those cells to help us see the activation for glutamate neurotransmitter.  The ongoing studies will help us better understand Alzheimers by understanding the core principles of glutamate and insulins.",Herbivore (Vegetarian),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is currently no long-term treatment for almost 40% of DLBCL patients. One possible target to pursue for therapeutic benefit in DLBCL is NEK2, a protein that plays a critical role in regulation from the G2 to M phase by facilitating centrosome disjunction. During interphase, the two centrioles are held close together by a complex of filamentous proteins. As the cell prepares to enter into mitosis, NEK2 phosphorylates this complex to promote centrosome separation and the formation of the mitotic spindle. We will test if a NEK2 proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) that was developed in the University of Arkansas for Medical Science’s pharmaceutical department will degrade NEK2 protein and inhibit the associated oncogenic pathways in DLBCL cell lines. We performed Western blots to detect NEK2 expression in the cell lines without NEK2 PROTAC treatment. Then we will compare these expression levels to the ones produced after PROTAC treatment. In addition, we will treat the cells with varying concentrations of the PROTAC to determine the effects on cell viability using the MTS assay.

The use of sertraline has been associated with rare but severe hepatotoxicity; however, the mechanism remains unclear. Previous research has demonstrated that ER stress, mitochondria impairment, and apoptosis are involved in sertraline-induced cytotoxicity. It has also been demonstrated that sertraline is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6. In this in vitro study, we used our established CYP2B6-overexpressed HepG2 cell line to investigate the role of CYP2B6 in sertraline-induced cytotoxicity. We found that the metabolism catalyzed by CYP2B6 significantly attenuated sertraline-induced cytotoxicity in comparison with vector control cells, as measured by LDH and MTS assays. Western Blot analysis demonstrated that less induction of ɣH2A.X, a hallmark of DNA damage, occurred in CYP2B6-overexpressed cells in comparison to the vector control under the same treatment of sertraline.

However, the combination of multi-marker immunohistochemistry (IHC) with multispectral imagining with complex per-cell quantitation methodologies has opened the door for more complex immune profiling of tumors and has implications in a range of other diseases where immune cells play a role. Specifically, we proposed to utilize multiplexed immunofluorescence (Opal® Multiplex Fluorescent IHC, Akoya Biosciences) coupled with multispectral imaging and advanced image analysis (inForm®, Akoya Biosciences) to evaluate immune response in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from patients diagnosed with different types of breast cancer. First, we developed protocols from the Opal® Multiplex Fluorescent IHC Kit to establish a multiplexed indirect immunofluorescence approach using FFPE blocks retrieved from the pathology archives. The kit allowed the simultaneous use of six standard unlabeled primary antibodies and detection with Opal reactive fluorophores that covalently label the epitope. After labeling is complete, antibodies are removed in a manner that did not disrupt the Opal fluorescence signal, permitting the next target to be detected without fear of antibody cross reactivity. Next, we will develop the advanced analysis workflow using the inForm® analysis software. The workflow will involve spectrally un-mixing and quantifying fluorescent activity intensity of each fluorophore. Once unmixed, inForm® will be used to segment tumor and stromal tissues, to identify and quantify cell types, assess fluorophore overlap, and provide information about individual cell phenotypes and spatial relationships. By having a panel of 6 different antibodies already assessed, it will be simple to substitute a new marker of interest in its place to compare a different immune response.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fortunately, cells have DNA repair pathways that seek out and correct damage. The bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga is an excellent model organisms to study DNA repair because it has a highly efficient DNA repair system. The mechanisms of DNA repair in these aquatic invertebrates are unknown. This project explores using RNA interference (RNAi) and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing as tools to investigate the function of DNA repair genes: MSH6 and MLH1 in bdelloid rotifers. Two methods of RNAi were explored. For the “feeding method,” bdelloids were fed strains of E. coli that express dsRNA copies of the MLH1. For the “soaking method,” double stranded RNA (dsRNA) copies of MSH6 were synthesized, and bdelloids were transfected with these molecules of MSH6. The expectation was that ingested or transfected dsRNA would induce RNAi in bdelloid rotifers. Real-time PCR followed to quantify expression of the target gene and determine if the RNAi knockdown was successful. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was done to mutate DNA repair genes. For utilizing CRISPR/Cas9, a single guide RNA that targets MLH1 was synthesized and used in a Cas9 in vitro cleavage assay to determine its ability to cut the target sequence. The guide RNA was then combined with Cas9, and these ribonucleoprotein complexes were electroporated into bdelloids. Mutation detection using T7 endonuclease was then done to identify alterations to the gene sequence. Gene knockdowns using RNAi and gene mutations using CRISPR/Cas9 will provide a reverse genetics approach to identify genes that have a role in bdelloid DNA repair. This could enhance our understanding of similar mechanisms in traditional model systems, which could have implications for biomedical research.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BPA has the capability of binding to estrogen receptors in the body, which can lead to various adverse effects. These concerning effects range from cardiovascular disease to developmental issues. As a result, BPA is regulated in many infant products; however, infant and children’s toothbrushes are not regulated. Previous studies in our lab have shown that some infant oral hygiene products release differing amounts of BPA into solvent (1:1 methanol/water) at room temperature over time. In this experiment, toothbrushes that were previously confirmed to contain BPA were analyzed to determine the effect of temperature on the amount of BPA released from the toothbrushes into the solution. Since the toothbrush is used in the oral cavity, which is not at room temperature, it is important to see how an increase in temperature affects the amount of BPA released. Each toothbrush was placed into a 150-mL beaker that contained 1:1 methanol/water solution. Each beaker was then placed into a water bath at 23˚ C, 30˚ C, or 37˚ C. Aliquots of solution (5 mL) were removed at time intervals ranging from 5 minutes to 48 hours, and an Edinburgh Instruments FS5 Spectrofluorometer was used to measure the fluorescence intensity of BPA in the solutions. These values were compared to a standard calibration curve of known concentrations of BPA, and the concentration of BPA in the solutions at each time point was determined. A graph for each temperature was then constructed, plotting the concentration of BPA released vs. the time interval.

Hubbard, PhD",Ouachita Baptist University,,,Arkansas State University,,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a compound which mimics estrogen, allowing BPA to bind to estrogen receptors in the body in place of estrogen. This mistaken binding results in BPA acting as an agonist and antagonist for certain mechanisms in the body, which can result in early development, reproductive issues, and cancer. Though BPA has been omitted in several infant products, there is no regulation on the amount of BPA that can be present in infant toothbrushes. Infants are more vulnerable to the effects of BPA because they are in such an early stage in the development of their endocrine systems. Previous research used fluorescence spectroscopy to detect BPA leaching from infant toothbrushes. BPA is excited at 278 nm and emits at 304 nm. 
This project focused on the effects of brushing on the level of BPA released by adding friction and movement to the toothbrush while it was soaking in the solution. To execute this research, an apparatus was developed that mimicked a brushing motion to apply friction to the toothbrushes. Several infant toothbrushes were each placed in a 1:1 methanol:water solution for time increments varying from five minutes to six hours. Aliquots (5 mL) were collected from the solutions after the toothbrushes had been soaked for each time interval. Samples were analyzed using an Edinburgh Instruments FS5 spectrofluorometer. The excitation and emission intensities of the samples were collected and compared to a calibration curve to determine the concentration of BPA present in each sample. Data were correlated with samples that were collected without brushing to determine if the friction affected the amount of BPA leached from the toothbrushes.

Simmen,University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third ranked cause of cancer-associated deaths in the United States.  CRC is characterized by metabolic and redox pathway dysregulation within tumors.  Our goal was to investigate a potential metabolic and redox pathway involving Malic Enzyme 1 (ME1) coupled to one or more members of the NOX/DUOX family.  ME1 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of S-malate to pyruvate and generates reduced NADP (NADPH) used, in part, for lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis.  We hypothesized that cytosolic NADPH generated by ME1 is also used by the NOX/DUOX family of proteins to generate increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the latter then promoting growth of intestinal tumors.  Our laboratory previously developed a new mouse model of intestinal cancer by crossing mice overexpressing ME1 in the intestinal mucosa (ME1-Tg mice) with ApcMin/+ mice that bear a mutation in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (Apc) gene.  We found an increase in number and size of intestinal tumors in ApcMin/+/ME1-Tg mice, compared to ApcMin/+ littermates.  In the present work, small and large intestines from these same mice were subject to immunohistochemistry (IHC) for NOX1, NOX4 and DUOX2 (three members of the NOX/DUOX protein family hypothesized to be highly expressed in normal intestines and their tumors).  Adenomas were highlighted by IHC for β-catenin.  IHC for NOX1 revealed staining in the uppermost regions of the villi of the normal appearing intestinal mucosa. NOX4 IHC stained the smooth muscle layers of the small intestines.  Neither NOX1 nor NOX4 IHC preferentially stained the adenomas.  DUOX2 IHC signal, in contrast, was localized to the proliferative cells of the crypts, and in the submucosa and adenomas (sporadic staining).  The data suggest physiological roles for NOX1, NOX4 and DUOX2 in intestinal physiology, and support a possible linkage of ME1 and DUOX2 in redox regulation of intestinal adenoma growth.

To avoid these outcomes, our cells have developed the DNA damage response (DDR) for detection and repair of DNA damage. One component of this protective mechanism is replication fork reversal in response to replication stress to prevent the fork from progressing across the DNA lesions and allow time for repair. When the replication fork reverses, the two new synthesized strands anneal resulting in a four way junction. If the regressed arm of the four way junction, which resembles a one-ended double strand break, is not protected, the nascent strands can be degraded by nucleases resulting in an unstable genome. Previous studies have found that BRAC2, RAD51, and other proteins involved in homologous recombination are required to protect the regressed arm against the degradation of the nascent strand. Prior studies have also shown that human DNA helicase B (HELB) inhibits end resection during homologous recombination. With this understanding, our goal was to determine if HELB is also involved in the protection of DNA at a stalled fork. Using human retina pigmented epithelial (RPE-1) cells, we knocked down HELB using siRNA, treated the cells with the DNA damaging agent hydroxyurea (HU), and used the fiber labeling technique to analyze DNA replication. Through this technique, we will be able to get a greater understanding of the cell’s ability to protect stalled replication forks in the absence of HELB.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When food is present the Dictyostelium lives as a unicellular amoeba. However, when food becomes scarce and the cell starves, aggregation of many unicellular amoebae is seen as they form a motile, multicellular “slug”. This slug responds to stimuli in its environment, particularly light, and moves to find a more suitable position upon which it forms a fruiting body for spore dispersion. While the means by which the slug moves is not fully understood, response to cAMP waves and varying intensity and quality of light as well as gravity are believed to be the most plausible reasons. In this experiment, slug movement of Dictyostelium was examined under the effects of red and blue light, as well as antigravity conditions which were produced by a clinostat. Blue light was observed to have the most effect on slug movement, while red light had the least effect on slug movement. Results also exhibit that gravity does affect slug movement. Slugs in stationary (non-gravity manipulated) plates showed affinity toward light, but slugs on a clinostat exposed to the same wavelength of light generally showed a higher affinity for that light. Slugs grown in the dark showed a preference for gravitaxis, indicating gravity has an effect on slug movement, but the slug’s response to light appears preferential to gravity.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To visualize MC4R, the Baldini lab generated knock-in mice expressing MC4R with a hemagglutinin tag (MC4R-HA). Previous studies of these mice revealed a reduction in MC4R-HA in the PVN of mice fed high fat diet (HFD) compared to that of mice treated with low fat diet (LFD). Additional studies of HFD-fed Sapphire mice, which express green fluorescent protein under the MC4R promoter, show a decrease in expression of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX IV) within PVN MC4R-expressing neurons, indicating that they may be injured. To determine whether injury by HFD to MC4R is recovered when obese mice return to normal weight, I measured abundance of MC4R-HA in the PVN of mice a) treated with LFD for 12 weeks, b) treated with HFD for 12 weeks, and c) mice treated with HFD for 8 weeks and then with LFD for another 4 weeks, returning to healthy weight. Compared to mice fed LFD, MC4R-HA was decreased by 98.3% in mice fed HFD. Mice switched from HFD to LFD did not have a reduction in MC4R-HA. Thus, diet alone is sufficient to restore MC4R in the brain. To determine mitochondrial damage in mice switched from HFD to LFD, we will measure expression of COX IV in MC4R-HA neurons. Additionally, we will model damage from HFD by exposing primary hypothalamic neurons to excess palmitate and determining structural changes. By determining whether there is mitochondrial injury to MC4R neurons in mice switched from HFD to LFD and changes in primary hypothalamic neurons exposed to excess palmitate, we may better understand what hypothalamic impairment remains in humans who have returned to healthy weight after obesity.",Herbivore (Vegetarian),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These anionic [Cl-Ni(mu-pz)3Ni-Cl-] dimers are synthesized by direct reaction of the corresponding sodium pyrazolide and tetrachloronickelate(II) ion in DMF. Each is stable in the solid state as its PPh4+ salt. This general approach is effective for a variety of bridging groups: pyrazole, 3,5-dimethylpyrazole, 3,4,5-trimethylpyrazole, and 4-chloro-3,5-dimethylpyrazole. Each of these dimer salts was characterized by MALDI-TOF MS and UV-visible electronic spectroscopy.  The [Cl-Ni(-Me2pz)3Ni-Cl-] salt was characterized by single crystal XRD, confirming for the first time the formation of this novel structure.  The similarity of the nickel(II) environment in this dimer and the well-characterized Tp*NiCl monomer invites contrasts and comparisons.  For example, the new dimer environment makes nickel(II) unusually unresponsive to Lewis basic DMF molecules, where Tp*NiCl binds this solvent immediately and reversibly. Room temperature magnetic measurements suggest each dimer possesses two independent high spin (S = 1) nickel(II) centers, as if the dimer represents two Tp*NiCl units sharing a bridge through the Tp* chelate. Electronic spectra of these dimers show the tell-tale signature of previously reported monomeric Tp*NiX (X = Cl, Br, I; all S = 1), reinforcing the model of these dimers as conjoined Tp*NiCl units. While their novel architecture makes these nickel-nickel dimers interesting on their own, these discrete high spin complexes (S ~ 2) can also be molecular magnets, well-defined magnetic centers that can be incorporated into nano-scale devices.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advances in cancer treatment have increased the survival rate of brain cancer patients. However, multiple studies have provided evidence that 50-90% of survivors that live more than 6 months experience cognitive dysfunction following radiotherapy. Radiation alters specific structures and regions of the brain including the hippocampus, white matter, and prefrontal cortex that are associated with memory loss, decline in verbal ability, and learning difficulties. Yet, there is minimal knowledge of what epigenetic mechanisms cause these radiation-induced cognitive injuries in the developing brain. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), non-coding RNAs that regulate gene silencing by targeting mRNA, could be a critical component in radiation-induced cognitive injuries. The aim of the current study is to assess whether the miRNA levels are different in juvenile mice exposed to whole brain irradiation (20Gy) in comparison to control mice (n=10 per group). One month following irradiation, the mice were tested for cognitive performance using the Y-maze and the Morris Water Maze. The behavioral findings of the sham and radiated mice were compared to miRNA profiles. Our behavioral data show that radiation impairs spatial memory but does not impair short-term memory or spatial learning.  Total RNA (both mRNA and miRNA) was isolated from mice hippocampi.  RNA integrity numbers were all greater than 6.0.  Total RNA is currently undergoing next generation sequencing to evaluate the transcriptome and over 400 miRNAs.  Our preliminary data confirms that hippocampal function is altered following irradiation of juvenile mice.  We aim to delineate epigenetic factors in the hippocampus that are potentially reversible.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DNA mismatch repair system consists of a system of proteins that work in collaboration with each other to recognize and repair mismatches that occur during DNA replication. The E. coli mismatch recognition protein, MutS, functions by recognizing existing mismatches and communicating with downstream proteins to initiate the repair process. Fluorescence anisotropy allowed for the characterization of the mismatch binding activity of MutS. The dissociation constant Kd, which shows the binding affinity of MutS to specific mismatches, can be obtained from this data. The ATPase activity of MutS in the presence of each base-base mismatch was observed with a spectrophotometric malachite green assay. With this information, the kcat can be determined to characterize the ATPase activity of MutS. Cancer, Huntington’s disease, and many other neurodegenerative diseases thrive when MutS homologs in the human mismatch repair system do not function as they should. More research into understanding the mechanics of MutS and mismatch repair will provide information to slow or prevent the progression of such diseases by allowing for the promotion or inhibition of MutS homologs and other similar proteins.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in large scale databases, a relational database can get rather complex and hard to understand for non-database experts – for a large medical facility handling thousands of patients, databases are composed of hundreds of separate tables. Additionally, to extract data from a relational database, researchers or data scientists must have deep knowledge of the database schema and a database management language. While this method works, my research demonstrates a different approach to store data, in the form of graph databases. A graph database is more visually intuitive, and its emphasis and ability to visualize groups of nodes and the relationships between them leads to a data-driven discovery approach, versus the traditional hypothesis-driven discovery [1]. A researcher using a graph database can simply open a graph database visualization tool and observe individual nodes and their connections to other nodes. This can lead to the discovery of connections and relationships between data points that a researcher may not have even considered using just the hypothesis-driven approach. On top of that, a graph database is still able to support the traditional methods of research – a researcher can query a graph database to receive contextualized and relevant data, much like he or she could do with relational databases.
The goal of this study is to discover specific advantages of graph databases over relational databases in a medical setting, as well as create a basic implementation of a graph database using Neo4J [2], coupled with an application that allows users to access the graph database and query it with ease. This three-pronged approach will demonstrate the effectiveness of graph databases in representing the complex relationships between data points generated in medical facilities, as well as demonstrate the benefits a transition to graph database models could generate.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overproduction of free radicals can induce cellular impairment by reacting with amino acids, lipids and proteins. This phenomenon, known as oxidative stress, results in several diseases in humans including cancer, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disorders, and obesity.  Dietary antioxidants such as the stilbenoid resveratrol (RSV) have been shown to reduce free radicals in vitro and in vivo. However, the antioxidant capacity of extracts enriched with RSV and related stilbenoids have been largely unexplored.  To this end, the aim of this project was to characterize the antioxidant activity of stilbenoid-rich extracts in vitro using the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assay combined with HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography). To produce the stilbenoid-rich extracts, hairy root cultures of peanut cultivar line Hull 3A were treated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, methyl jasmonate, hydrogen peroxide, and magnesium chloride for 168 hours. RSV and the prenylated stilbenoid arachidin-1 (A1), arachidin-2 (A2), arachidin-3 (A3), and arachidin-5 (A5) were detected in the ethyl acetate extract of the culture medium by HPLC. Upon reaction with DPPH, the HPLC peak areas of A1, A3, and A5 decreased significantly, suggesting that these compounds reacted with DPPH. However, RSV and A2 apparently did not react with DPPH. Ongoing studies focus on elucidating the antioxidant capacity of different fractions of the extract containing either RSV or prenylated stilbenoids. Our result suggests that the stilbenoid composition of the extract influences the antioxidant activity. Extracts enriched with select stilbenoids may provide an alternative to RSV as dietary supplements for the prevention of diseases in humans.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

	Selenoproteins play an important role in the human body by accomplishing essential biological functions like oxido-reductions, antioxidant defense, thyroid hormone metabolism and immune response; therefore, the possibility to synthesize selenium nanoparticles free of any contaminants is exciting for future nano-medical applications. This paper reports the synthesis of selenium nanoparticles by a 1064 ns Nd:YAG laser ablation in 5 mL of de-ionized (DI) water. Then we irradiate our target at various repetition rates that ranged from 100 Hz to 5000 Hz. The particles were irradiated for 5 minutes. We found our optimal repetition rate for production of nanostructures to be 3027 ± 57 Hz and the shape of the nanoparticles appears to be an optimal sphere. This method does not require a clean room, vacuum system, or highly dangerous and/ or expensive chemicals.  We characterized our NS via AES, UV-vis spectroscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, AFM, SEM, and TEM.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wijeratne,Arkansas State University,,"Soybean is the second largest crop and holds a considerable fraction of economic revenue in the US. Phytophthora stem and root rot (PSR), which is caused by an oomycete, Phytophthora sojae is one of the primary diseases of soybean with an annual crop loss of $200 million in the US alone. Disease management is primarily achieved by employing plants with dominant resistance genes to P. sojae (Rps). However, the use of a single resistance gene leads to new pathogenic races to overcome the resistance. Therefore, manipulation of regulatory genes that acts downstream of Rps genes to modulate the defense response, provide a better approach to make more durable soybean resistance to P. sojea. The main goal of this project is to use cutting-edge genome and bioinformatic tools to identify critical genes in the regulatory network associated with resistance to P. sojae in soybean. We have used co-expression network analysis using publicly available expression data to identify regulatory genes. We are currently using the novel genome editing technology, CRISPR/Cas9, to create mutations in these genes to test the hypothesis that in the absence of these genes, soybean plants will become more susceptible to P. sojea. Once verified, these regulatory genes can be used to create transgenic soybean plants that overexpress the genes and will have constitute resistance against P. sojae.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for the potential heterodimeric nature of this enzyme resides primarily in its gene structure containing the ATGA coexpression motif between putative TsdA and TsdB genes at Hneap_1476 and Hneap_1477 gene loci. This coexpression motif is accompanied by an upstream Shine-Dalgarno sequence within the 1st gene. In order to test the hypothesis that this is indeed a heterodimeric thiosulfate dehydrogenase comprised of Hneap_1476 and Hneap_1477 gene products and that the genes are coexpressed, PCR based mutagenesis will be used to perform numerous knockouts within the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Genomics have been used to ensure that PCR primers designed do not create an alternative SD. This is seen as significant since 272, or 11.3% of the 2414 identified genes in the H. neapolitanus genome possess the ATGA motif. Analysis of all ATGA motifs shows no significant difference in distribution between leading and lagging strands, housekeeping versus non-housekeeping genes or sulfur oxidizing genes. Alignment of identified SD sequences shows significant base distributions in positions 1, 2 and 6, with position 1 showing 55%A, 26%C and 10%G. Position 6 is similar with 62%G, 17%C and 14%A.  Position 2 displays 72%G and 16% C. Positions 3, 4 and 5 however show much higher conservation with >81% G, A and G respectively. This yields a consensus sequence of A/C, G/C, G, A, G, G/C/A.

In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD, there is an accumulation of fat in liver cells unattributed to alcohol consumption. NAFLD shows a positive correlation to obesity, insulin resistance, as well as inflammation, causing additional injury to hepatocytes in the liver. Previous studies have shown that exposure to high-fat diets gives rise to weight gain, hyperleptinemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hepatosteatosis in male mice. When obese mice switch to a low-fat diet, they return to a normal weight. The objective is to determine if there are persistent effects of obesity by exposure to high-fat diets that will induce permanent damage to the liver even after the mice have returned to a healthy weight. To monitor lipid abundance in the liver, the staining of liver sections was carried out using Nile Red, which becomes brightly fluorescent within lipid droplets. The results indicate that average lipid droplet sizes within the sections of the mice who have switched diets have returned to normal. Further experimentation will be done to determine the amount of DNA damage present and whether hepatocytes regenerate more efficiently after the mice have returned to a normal weight in comparison to mice kept on a high-fat diet. Hepatocyte regeneration is monitored by BrdU incorporation into cell DNA. The detection of Glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78), an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, will also be studied to determine if its presence is restored in livers of the mice who have returned to a normal weight. This research will convey the importance of weight loss in order to recover from hepatosteatosis.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first step of the mismatch repair process, the MutS family of proteins recognize and bind to base-base mismatches and signal to activate downstream repair proteins, although the details of these mechanisms are debated in the literature. The DNA mismatch recognition protein E. coli MutS has high affinity for G/T, A/C, G/G, and A/A mismatches, which the mismatch repair system repairs with high efficiency. A/G, C/T, T/T, and C/C mismatches are repaired with lower efficiency. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms of DNA mismatch recognition, fluorescence anisotropy measurements were used to assess the binding characteristics of MutS to eight mismatch types. A Fluoromax-4 fluorometer was used to measure the fluorescence anisotropy of emissions from TAMRA-labeled DNA as the concentration of MutS protein was varied. Origin was used to fit a 1:1 binding equation curve to ensemble anisotropy data, which allowed for the dissociation constant to be determined. The binding affinity measurements agreed with what is known from the literature, indicating that the anisotropy analysis method can be relied upon for generating reproducible protein association data and for providing insights into the mechanics of protein-DNA interactions. Since MutS-mismatch binding affinity correlates with mismatch repair efficiency, the data will be used in comparing the binding kinetics of MutS with efficiently repaired mismatches to the binding kinetics of MutS with less efficiently repaired mismatches. Clarifying the mechanism of mismatch recognition in E. coli is important because it is possible that the process is conserved across nature.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By taking advantage of 3D printing, a low-cost scanning absorption spectrometer has been designed and built. The spectrometer utilizes an Arduino to control the movement of the rotation stage and receive data from a photoresistor, a variable resistor that decreases in resistance as light intensity increases. Spectra obtained from the homebuilt spectrometer are compared to spectra obtained using a commercially available Agilent Cary 100 spectrophotometer.

Tumor penetration was studied at time points of 2 hours, 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours, and were analyzed with imaging techniques. Various assays were conducted to characterize penetration: dark field microscopy, RAMAN spectra, and two-photon microscopy. Fluorescent markers were not used in identifying nanoparticles in the organoids due to the introduction of unwanted interferences.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Radiation therapy uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors, however, it simultaneously damages healthy tissue. In the central nervous system (CNS) cell damage can lead to neurocognitive impairments stemming from a decline of hippocampal neurogenesis. Neuropsychological evaluations of cancer survivors have demonstrated neurological deficits controlled by the hippocampus; a structure responsible for learning and memory. Commonly reported irradiation-induced cognitive impairments include working memory, cognitive control and flexibility, cognitive processing speed, visual searching, planning, and general attention. The aim of our study is to investigate the radiation effects on cognition and gene expression in the hippocampus in juvenile male mice. Fourteen 3-week-old male C57BL/6 mice received a single 0 Gy dose of radiation or a 10 Gy dose of radiation with the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP). Five weeks after irradiation, animals were tested for hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments in the  Morris Water Maze. A significant impairment in spatial memory retention was observed in the probe trial after the first day of hidden platform training in animals that received radiation. We are currently performing qPCR analyses in order to quantify changes in expression of ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDA/AMPA), pre/post synaptic markers and pro-inflammatory markers.

High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a known risk factor for lymphedema; however, the mechanisms by which hypertension increases the risk of lymphedema remains unclear.  Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a potent vasoconstrictor important to blood pressure regulation, and increased levels of Ang II have been observed in hypertensive states. The transport of lymph fluid from the tissues back to circulation critically relies on the rhythmic contraction of lymph vessels.  The purpose of our study was to define the effect of Ang II on lymph vessel rhythmic contractions.  We used edge detection software to monitor changes in diameter in isolated, cannulated rat mesenteric lymph vessels. The addition of Ang II acutely inhibited lymph vessel contractions and caused vessel constriction. Collectively in 5 lymph vessels, Ang II completely abolished contractions for ~1.76 mins and reduced resting diameter to ~60% from baseline. Prior blockade of angiotensin II Type 1 (AT1) receptors with losartan prevented the effects of Ang II, suggesting the presence of functional AT1 receptors in these lymph vessels. Future studies are needed to determine the role of Ang II and AT1 receptors in normal lymphatic function and blood pressure regulation.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BPAF has the highest persistence in the environment. However, due to the recency of the increased usage of BPAF, there are not many studies on the impact of BPAF on the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This study was conducted to asses the developmental and sex-based effects of BPAF on the mRNA expression of genes involved in immune response in the GIT in rodents. Rodents were dietary exposed to BPAF [ 0ppm (control),250ppm, and 1000ppm] in the feed throughout the developmental stages from gestation day 4. Animals were then sacrificed to collect the terminal ileum on the post-natal day (PND) 4, PND 28 and week 13.  The RNA was then extracted from the ileum by using TRIzol reagent. The RNA was DNAse treated and converted to cDNA. The mRNA expression for 84 genes was collected using RT2 Profiler PCR Array (antibacterial response array; PARN-148Z) and analyzed using Qiagen online PCR analysis tool. The study shows that PND 4 (1000ppm) males had 6 genes (Card 6, Jun, Map 2k3, Rela, Tlr1) significantly down-regulated, while female had these same 6 genes significantly up-regulated. These genes are involved in pathogen recognition (Tlr 1), as well as antibacterial response (Jun and Map 2k3 ) and apoptosis (Card 6). The interactions of these genes may have lead to the increased or decreased inflammatory responses in the male and female respectively and could be seen in the differential regulation of the ReLa gene. However, 13 weeks old males on low dose (250ppm) of BPAF had 3 genes (Fadd, Hsp90aa, Rac 1 – involved in apoptosis) significantly up-regulated but their female counterparts had no significant changes in any of these gene.

Breast cancer survivor rates continue to increase as diagnostic tools and treatments improve; however, the consequences of these treatments remain an issue. Chemotherapy is indicated for early and advanced or metastatic breast cancers. While such regimens are effective, chemotherapy can lead to severe cognitive impairments that persist long after treatment in as many as 75% of survivors. Impairment commonly referred to as chemobrain is characterized by symptoms such as confusion, memory deficits, and difficulty concentrating. The goal of the current study was to identify late effects of Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, and Paclitaxel (AC-T) on cognition and characterize molecular pathways in the hippocampus are affected after treatment. Results from the Morris watermaze revealed long-term memory impairments in chemotherapy treated mices. Next, quantitative analysis of gene expression was performed on the RT2 Profile PCR Array matrix “Oxidative Stress”. 84 genes were profiled, including genes related to antioxidants, involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, and oxygen transport. Gpx1, Nos2, and Prdx5 were three of the up-regulated genes chosen to be validated by single-gene RT-qPCR. Txnrd3, Ucp2, and Prdx2 were three of the down-regulated genes chosen to be validated by single-gene RT-qPCR. Using RT-qPCR, the selected genes were found to be insignificant between the saline and AC-T treatment groups. Additional testing showed that Sod1 was significantly elevated in the AC-T mice despite its lack of appearance in initial data. qPCR analysis is currently being performed to look at relative expression of AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, and synaptic markers of integrity on the left hippocampus of mice.

Vector-borne spirochetes of the genus Borrelia utilize ticks and the human body louse as vectors. By traveling through the bite of a colonized vector, a subset of these bacteria can be transmitted to humans and initiate the disease known as relapsing fever. Studies into relapsing fever are few in number, despite the disease being identified in the early 20th century. Relapsing fever are divided into two groups; New World relapsing fever Borrelia are found in the Americas and Old World relapsing fever Borrelia are common in Africa.  Of the limited research, the focus is mainly on New World relapsing fever Borrelia species. However, Old World relapsing fever Borrelia are responsible for a higher percentage of the world’s relapsing fever cases. The scarcity of molecular biology and genetic resources suitable for Old World relapsing fever Borrelia results in insufficient understanding of the spirochetes’ lifecycle, pathogenesis, and interaction within its host. To address this discrepancy concerning the lack of appropriate procedures for the genetic manipulation of Old World relapsing fever Borrelia, various tools and methods for the genetic manipulation of Borrelia duttonii, an Old World relapsing fever spirochete, will be developed. The set of genetic tools constructed for Borrelia duttonii included the creation of a B. duttonii specific shuttle vector, the development of a site-specific integration construct that targets the B. duttonii pl165 linear plasmid, and the inactivation of the B. duttonii p66 gene. We have also tested existing Borrelia electroporation methods to determine whether they are suitable for transformation of B. duttonii.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of these important functions of sleep spindles, the effects that neurological disorders have on them have been of special interest to neurobiologists. Studies conducted on patients with epilepsy have examined the generalized effect of epilepsy on sleep spindles. The studies have shown a general decrease in both the density and frequency of sleep spindles in patients with epilepsy. However, there is a lack of research on the effect of ictal activity on the subsequent night’s sleep spindle density. The purpose of this study is to compare the density of sleep spindles of patients with epilepsy in sleep following ictal activity and in sleep without ictal activity. Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) data were provided by the University of Arkansas for the Medical Sciences. Using the programs MATLAB and Brainstorm the data were processed and converted into a .mat file type. This conversion was necessary to enable scoring and detection of sleep spindles by the program Visbrain. We used patients who had twenty four hour periods containing at least one ictal event and who also had a twenty four hour period without an ictal event. Using a band pass filter (low pass 1 Hz, High pass 70 Hz), a notch filter (at 60 Hz), and the program Visbrain, the sleep stages of the patients were processed and scored. Visbrain was then used to calculate the density of sleep spindles in NREM sleep. Our findings demonstrate a negative correlation between ictal activity and sleep spindle density when compared to periods with no ictal activity.  The effect is most pronounced within the first hour of post-ictal sleep with a trend back to baseline after the first hour.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Optomechanical parts were designed using CAD software and can be constructed using 3D printed plastic components and parts available at a hardware store. Absorption is measured with the use of a charge coupled device (CCD) and an Arduino. Because the parts can be constructed by anyone with access to a 3D printer, the spectrophotometer is accessible to a broader audience by a significantly reduced cost and allowing access to more remote areas by bypassing the need for shipment of parts and instead printing and assembling parts in the span of hours.

Two of these subunits, PIG-U and GPAA1, have previously been characterized as oncogenes in bladder cancer and breast cancer, respectively. Elevated plasma levels of GPI-anchored proteins in glioma patients have been documented relative to non-malignant controls. Additionally, GPAA1 overexpression has previously been linked to physical association of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with GPIT, resulting in phosphorylation of the subunits PIG-T and PIG-U. However, the relationship between GPIT and EGFR is not well characterized, particularly in GBM. EGFRvIII, a variant EGFR that is commonly seen in GBM patients, has a truncated extracellular region that allows it to constitutively phosphorylate substrates without a signal ligand binding. It is suspected that this may lead to the upregulation of GPIT subunits, and thus an increase in GPI-anchored proteins. Based on the previously established relationship between EGFR and GPIT, this unregulated constitutive phosphorylation may also cause an increase in GPIT activation in patients with EGFRvIII. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the expression levels of GPIT subunits in GBM with and without the EGFRvIII mutation. These studies will increase our understanding of the oncogenic relationship between GPIT and EGFR and the therapeutic potential for GPIT inhibition in GBM.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CC mouse model is a state-of-art mouse strain that represents a genetic diversity similar to the human population. Six weeks old CC mice were fed either high-fat diet (42% Kcal from milk fat high in palmitic acid, 0.2% of total cholesterol, and >30% high sucrose (HFD; experimental group)) or low-fat and reduced sucrose diet (control group) for 12 weeks. We had previously identified certain strains of CC mice which harbor a distinct population of microbes due to HFD. RNA was extracted from banked ileal tissue obtained from ten different strains of CC mouse.  The RNA samples were then treated with DNAse and converted into cDNA to assess the mRNA expression level of 84 different genes known to be involved in the epithelial cell integrity. The CT values were recorded, and the data was analyzed using Qiagen PCR Array Data Analysis Tool. The preliminary data indicates that the susceptible male mice (CC mice where microbiota was affected due to HFD) showed higher number of up-regulated genes. Few of these genes are Claudins, which may assist in controlling the permeability of the paracellular barrier between tight junctions. The resistant male mice (CC mice where microbiota was not affected due to HFD) showed down-regulation of several genes such as Occludins, which also assist in controlling the permeability of the paracellular barrier. This in turn indicates looser tight junctions and more permeability between the cells.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Harper, Alex Crocker, Claire E. Turkal, Lauren Joseph, and Andrea A. Duina",Hendrix College,,,Arkansas State University,,"In eukaryotic cells, histone chaperones can manipulate chromatin environments to facilitate a variety of processes that occur on DNA, including gene transcription. FACT (FAcilitates Chromatin Transactions) is a highly conserved histone chaperone complex that plays important roles during the initiation and elongation phases of transcription.  In yeast, FACT is composed of two proteins, Spt16 and Pob3, which can interact directly with nucleosomes with the assistance of the HMG-box protein Nhp6.  Previous research from our laboratory has identified a region on the nucleosome – which we refer to as the ISGI (Influences Spt16-Gene Interactions) region – that is required for proper dissociation of FACT from the 3’ ends of genes at the end of the transcription process. To further investigate the mechanisms that control FACT dissociation from genes, we are carrying out studies to determine possible roles for DNA sequences in this process.  To determine if DNA sequences play a role in FACT dissociation from genes, we have generated fourteen internal deletions within the 3’ end of the constitutively expressed yeast gene PMA1 and assessed their effects on Spt16 dissociation.  These studies identified a region within the 3’ end of PMA1 required for normal dissociation of Spt16 from chromatin.  To determine whether this region controls Spt16 dissociation indirectly by impairing RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) termination, we are currently assessing the effects of deletion of this region on Pol II dissociation.  We are also assessing the effects of the other thirteen internal deletions on Pol II-gene dissociation.  Together, these studies will provide insights into possible direct or indirect roles for specific DNA sequences in ensuring proper Spt16 dissociation from genes following the transcription process.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This decline and loss of motor control is caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta in the brain. Ninety percent of all Parkinson’s cases are considered idiopathic, meaning that there is no known cause of the disease. There has recently been increased interest in the implication of the hippocampal region of the brain, especially in the early stages of Parkinson’s, due to the fact that some common symptoms overlap with functions of the hippocampus. Additionally, some of the issues that have been determined to be comorbid to Parkinson’s develop in the hippocampus. It has been determined previously that there is not a statistically significant difference in the size of the hippocampal regions between healthy controls, Parkinson’s Disease patients, and Parkinson’s Disease patients with some cognitive impairment.   Now, it will be explored whether or not any shape changes are occurring in the hippocampal regions.  This will be done using the FIRST, vertex analysis, and randomise utilities of the FSL program to compare the individual voxels of different structures at a vertex-wise basis, and determine whether the differences are statistically significant.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mutational activation or the over-expression of the Ras superfamily has been observed in a number of human cancer; which over the years, efforts have been focused on the inhibition of the Ras superfamily proteins that lead to cancer. The protein Cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42), is a member of the Rho GTPase family, a Ras subfamily member, which acts as a molecular switch and signals multicellular pathways to influence a variety of biological responses such as motility, morphology, and gene expression. The activation of Cdc42 is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) by the exchange of GDP and GTP; and deactivated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) which turn the protein off by stimulating GTP hydrolysis. The deregulation of Cdc42 affects the natural activity of cells, leading to the development of many pathological disorders in humans such as cancer. It has been observed that the over-expression of this protein has been related to play a critical role in non-small lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma just to name a few.  The focus of this study is to analyze small organic molecule-protein interactions aiming to find a molecule which inhibits the oncogenic behavior of Cdc42.

The sole structural difference between these two compounds is that meloxicam has a methyl substituent on C5 of the thiazole, where sudoxicam has a hydrogen. In clinical studies, sudoxicam was associated with severe hepatotoxicity, whereas meloxicam is commonly used with rare cases of toxicity. The cause for variable toxicity of thiazole compounds is undetermined. It has been shown that both sudoxicam and meloxicam undergo a multistep P450 catalyzed bioactivation pathway, proposed to be initiated by epoxidation at the thiazole. This pathway ultimately produces an alpha dicarbonyl and a toxic sulfonamide as cometabolites. Interestingly, meloxicam can be metabolically detoxified at the methyl substituent. The relative importance of the bioactivation pathway compared to the detoxification pathway is unknown because kinetics for the bioactivation are undetermined. For these studies, we developed a method to quantitate formation of the dicarbonyl metabolite via fluorescent DMB (1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene) labeling with HPLC/fluorescence detection. We have established steady state conditions for dicarbonyl formation from both substrates. Our kinetic experiments show that the bioactivation pathway is biphasic and more efficient for sudoxicam. The meloxicam detoxification pathway is more efficient than both bioactivation pathways. We are determining which enzymes catalyze the bioactivation pathway for both compounds using in vitro experiments with human liver microsomes and various P450 inhibitors. Our results suggest that both bioactivation and detoxification pathways have roles in the decreased toxicity of meloxicam, and alterations to either could impact the idiosyncratic toxicity of meloxicam. This knowledge will facilitate more accurate assessments of the potential risks of metabolites from thiazole-containing drugs and promote more personalized patient care.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The toxicological response associated with the drug in hepatic cells were investigated using different biochemical assays that focused on ER stress as the main contributing factor to cell toxicity. In this study, perhexiline was tested with HepG2 cells to observe the effects of the drug on cell viability, as well as target specific protein markers related to ER-stress. Cytotoxicity assays were conducted in order to examine HepG2 viability with exposure to increasing concentrations of perhexiline. LDH release and ATP content were measured in addition to cell viability via MTS assay. These results revealed that LDH release increased, suggesting a higher degree of cell membrane degradation, while both ATP content and cell viability decreased with increasing concentration of perhexiline. The underlying mechanisms of cell toxicity were then determined by observing the specific markers associated with ER stress. An RNA assay was conducted to study the upstream factors that induced ER stress, including PERK, ATF-6α, and IRE1. Using RT-PCR, a 2-fold change was observed for IRE1 and PERK pathways. These upstream factors lead to the activation of typical ER stress protein including, CHOP, ATF-4, and p-eIF2α. Through a western blot assay, an increase in activation of the protein markers were observed with increasing concentration of perhexiline. The results of these assays provided evidence that perhexiline induced toxicity in HepG2 cells through the activation of ER stress proteins.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wight,University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,,"Enteric glia are specialized peripheral glial cells within the gastrointestinal tract. They have been implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide range of neurological and digestive disorders, such as Crohn’s and Parkinson’s diseases and Multiple Sclerosis. Although enteric glia does not form myelin, the mouse myelin proteolipid protein gene (mPlp1) has been shown to be expressed in these cells. PLP is a tetraspan protein. It is the most abundant protein in CNS myelin. However, the role for PLP in enteric glia is unknown. Our research group has previously reported that an hPLP1-lacZ transgene called 6.2hPLP(+)Z/FL is highly expressed in oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cell type of the CNS. The transgene utilizes a portion of human PLP1 (proximal 6.2 kb of 5ʹ-flanking DNA to the first 38 bp of exon 2) to drive expression of a lacZ reporter cassette. The goal of this study is to determine whether the 6.2hPLP(+)Z/FL transgene is expressed in enteric glia. Intestinal tissue isolated from transgenic mice was stained with X-Gal and S-Gal to assess transgene expression. X-Gal stained cells in both transgenic and wild-type mice and therefore cannot be used to selectively discern transgene expression (i.e. β-Galactosidase activity). Therefore, we plan to stain the remaining tissue sections with S-Gal, which has been reported to be more selective for bacterial β-Galactosidase, which is encoded by the lacZ gene. If successful, these results will demonstrate that the hPLP1 sequences contained in 6.2hPLP(+)Z/FL are sufficient to drive lacZ expression in enteric glia.",Herbivore (Vegetarian),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Halogenation is prevalent in the market due to its improvement of druggability. Halogenation is thought to prevent unwanted bioactivation, increase a drug’s intake and clearance, and increase drug efficacy. However, it is unknown how halogenation affects compound enzymatic metabolism because no systematic analysis exists on how halogens impact substrate recognition or the kinetics of metabolite formation.  We hypothesize that our novel methodology incorporating informatics, modeling, and experimental studies will reveal the role of molecular structure in bioactivation of halogenated aromatic drugs into quinone reactive metabolites. We have extracted 259 halogenated compounds from the FDA DILIrank database and modeled their possible bioactivation into quinones using a deep neural network model developed by our collaborative group. We chose N-arylacetic acid NSAIDs as a test case. Four drug family members were identified as likely to undergo bioactivation into quinones, but the reaction remained unverified experimentally. We used an in-house method to trap quinones with fluorescently labeled glutathione to establish that reactions form product linearly in a pseudo-first order manner for the first 60 minutes. Additionally, we have observed that 0.5 mg/ml human liver microsomes are required to maintain pseudo-first order for these sixty minutes. We will use this information to begin steady-state reactions in order to measure the kinetics of the drugs of interest. Altogether, these findings will advance understanding of the basis of bioactivation of this critical class of molecules and validate our methodology as a basis for revealing the relationships of halogens on bioactivation of drugs into quinones.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trapped by addiction, users of these drugs experience symptoms of toxicity such as vomiting, tachycardia, and death. These effects originate from the prolonged binding of synthetic cannabinoids to cannabinoid receptors; therefore, the metabolic clearance is a critical determinant in the response to drug exposure. The study of metabolism of the 1-pentyl-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide (PINACA) class of synthetic cannabinoids has been hampered by the lack of authentic standards for its many metabolites. Current semiquantitative MS based methods are unreliable, leading us to design a fluorescence-based approach to determine the steady-state kinetics for 5F-APINACA metabolism by human liver microsomes. Previous studies suggest that the core indazole scaffold is not altered by metabolism, allowing for the inference that fluorescent response of the metabolites is preserved. We identified six putative metabolites and found that three yielded profiles for subsequent analyses. A monohydroxylation reaction demonstrated Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a high affinity for substrate (Km 20 µM Km) and highest rate of turnover (Vmax). The second highest rate of turnover was attributed to a dihydroxylation reaction exhibiting substrate inhibition (Km 4 µM, Ki 97 µM). The kinetics for formation of a defluorinated dihydroxylation metabolite also demonstrated substrate inhibition (Km 3 µM, Ki 370 µM). The low Kms for reactions indicate significant recognition and metabolism of the primary drug and its metabolites; however, inhibition mechanisms could suppress those pathways. Collectively, this could contribute to prolonging their effects in vivo. We hope that these novel quantitative studies of 5F-APINACA and its metabolites will open the door to more knowledge about the metabolic impacts of this class of drugs in the human body.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our research has focused on using exosomes isolated from differentiated neurons as a means to suppress GBM.  Exosomes isolated from differentiating neurons were used as a potential suppressor of tumor growth and mobility. Research in our lab has shown differentiated PC-12 cells, or rat neuron-like stem cells, to release exosomes that promote neuron differentiation in the absence of neuro-growth inducers.

Studies involving ABC DLBCL demonstrate a reliance on mutations in the B-cell receptor (BCR) pathway, including the scaffolding protein CARD11 and the MYD88 signaling protein. Here, our study examines a possible therapeutic strategy for ABC DLBCL, which involves targeting G-quadruplexes (G4) in the promoter regions of the genes critical for ABC DLBCL cell survival. The G4 is a DNA secondary structure characterized by a vertical stacking of guanine tetrads within a guanine-rich sequence of DNA. Recent studies suggest G4s act as transcription regulatory units, or switches, that can turn transcription on or off. We hypothesize that stabilizing the G4 structures within the CARD11 and MYD88 genes will result in a decrease of gene transcription and, by effect, constitutive signaling of the BCR. We identified G4 interactive compounds using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) melt based screen of 1584 compounds from the NCI Diversity VI library. Subsequent spectral analysis will validate the ability of “hit” compounds to affect the G4 structure stabilization. We will then utilize a MTS cytotoxicity assay to assess cell viability when DLBCL cell lines are treated with validated hit compounds. The examination of G4 structures with a focus on gene transcription provides a new, exciting, and potentially successful alternative treatment approach for ABC DLBCL.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these experiments, two cohorts of animals exposed to, 0 Gray (Gy), 11Gy, and 12.5Gy, of radiation, over a 60-day time course, were combined. Plasma samples taken from the non-human primates treated with varying intensities of radiation, were used to perform metabolomics experiments. 
Both univariate and multivariate statistical analysis are applied on the datasets. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to identify biochemical compounds that differ significantly between experimental groups. For statistical significance testing, p-values obtained from ANOVA will be adjusted based on criteria of the false discovery rate (q-value) to take into account the multiple comparisons that normally occur in metabolomics-based studies. Along with this, fold change (Log 2) will be calculated and used to measure the change in metabolite expression levels. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will then be used to better visualize the data, by transforming the high dimensional datasets in to a shadow of 2-dimensional features, to observe potential clustering of features. Likewise, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) will be used to test if the variables in the data allow to distinguish the metabolites, and to visualize the observations on a 2-dimensional map that shows as well as possible how separated the groups are. Through these methods, the goal is to identify metabolite biomarkers associated with partial body radiation exposure.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common site of primary cancer that metastasizes to the brain is the lung cancer. Currently radiation remains the primary treatment modality for lung BM. Radio resistance leads to treatment failure but mechanisms of radio resistance are poorly understood. Cancer stem cells are thought to be the main mediators of radioresistant pathways.  In this study, we use patient derived lung BM tumoroids to evaluate how cells become radio resistant.  We hypothesized that tumoroids from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients will have more radio resistant cells than tumoroids from small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. Tumoroids from a NSCLC and a SCLC patient were exposed to various levels of radiation (0Gy, 5Gy, 10Gy, and 20Gy).  All four groups were characterized by Flow cytometry, Immunofluorescence, and Genomic sequencing. Markers for cancer stem cells (sox2 and CD133) were assessed.


Results: Both NSCLC and SCLC BM tumoroids had the presence of cancer stem cells as confirmed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry.  Imagestream flow cytometry demonstrated that the cancer stem cell population had significant morphological and size differences in comparison to cancer cells.  Following radiation therapy, both NSCLC and SCLC BM tumoroids contained living cells after 72 hours even at 20Gy  (XX% and YY%, respectively).  Single cell sequencing will be used to delineate transcriptome differences in these radioresistant cancer cell populations.

Conclusion: Patient derived tumoroids provide a promising model to study radioresistant pathways in metastatic lung cancer to the brain.

Interaction between skin microbiota and immune networks of human host play an integral role on skin and systemic health. Nano-scale titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) minerals are commonly used in sunscreens as inorganic physical sun blockers. Studies have demonstrated that nano-particles have antibacterial activity against biofilm and intracellular bacteria. Thus, externally applied sunscreens containing nano-scale materials may impact the microbial ecology of the skin and further affect human health by disrupting the skin permeability barrier, increasing susceptibility to infection, and impairing functions of human immunity. To evaluate potential risk of dermal exposure of nano-materials to skin health, in this study the impact of TiO2 and ZnO on the growth and viability of skin bacteria was investigated. Six skin bacteria species were treated with coated or uncoated nano-particles in presence or absence of UVA exposure. The growth and viability of bacteria were examined by liquid and plate assays. Our results showed that tested TiO2 and coated ZnO didn’t obviously affect skin bacteria growth, while uncoated ZnO significantly decreased bacteria number in both liquid and plate assay. Different bacteria strains have different sensitivity to uncoated ZnO. And UV exposure enhanced antibacterial effect of uncoated ZnO on some bacteria strains. The information from this study will extend FDA’s knowledge about sunscreen products and nano-particles and help FDA’s regulatory mission of these products.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within proper dosage, it helps by blocking calcium entry into the vascular smooth muscle cells and the cardiomyocytes.  As a result, it relaxes blood vessels and increases the oxygenated blood supply to the heart.  However, the American Poison Control Center reported 11,000 cases of overdose by calcium channel blockers in 2011 and verapamil was the most implicated agent; 78 of those cases were fatal.   To determine whether verapamil toxicity can be prevented in vivo, we used zebrafish embryos, which are an ideal model system for studies on drug toxicity/safety assessment.  Verapamil’s adverse effects on the overall development and heart rate was dose-dependent.  We explored whether the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which has been recently shown to increase intracellular calcium in mammalian cells would ameliorate verapamil toxicity.  NAC, an antidote to acetaminophen overdose, is also used in a variety of other areas due to its ability to scavenge excess reactive oxygen species.  We found that NAC is cardioprotective and partially prevents the toxic effects of verapamil in zebrafish embryos after a 20-h treatment.  However, NAC co-treatment with verapamil completely restored heart rate to normal levels after a 2-h (short-term) treatment, suggesting that more research is needed to determine the half-life of NAC and if replenishing NAC at intervals during the 20-h treatment would increase the efficacy.  Using Hb9-GFP transgenic zebrafish embryos, which are genetically engineered for the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in motor neurons, we examined the effects of verapamil on these neurons and preliminary results showed no evidence of motor neuron toxicity by verapamil or NAC.

Stilbenoids are natural products that have shown antioxidant, anticancer and anti-obesity properties.  Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) is able to produce these compounds as phytoalexins, protecting it against fungal pathogens. Hairy roots of peanut produced via Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation have the ability to produce stilbenoids when exposed to elicitors or stress inducing compounds thus providing a sustainable bioproduction platform for stilbenoids.   In this project, peanut hairy root cultures were co-treated with the elicitors methyl jasmonate, cyclodextrin, hydrogen peroxide and magnesium chloride to activate the biosynthesis of stilbenoids. After 168 hours and 192 hours of elicitation, stilbenoids were extracted from the culture medium with ethyl acetate and the extracts were analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The analyses showed that the extracts contained the non-prenylated stilbenoids resveratrol and piceatannol, as well as the prenylated stilbenoids arachidin-1, arachidin-2, arachidin-3 and arachidin-5. In addition, several other unknown compounds were also present in the extracts. In order to study the biological activity of the prenylated stilbenoids, several extracts are then pooled and analyzed by HPLC. The pooled extracts and purified stilbenoids will be used in in vitro and in vivo assays to elucidate their biological activity with the ultimate goal to identify novel natural products with potential applications in human health.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One such protein is Human DNA Helicase B (HELB). The role of HELB in the DNA damage response is not fully understood. HELB responds to DNA damage caused by hydroxyurea and the topoisomerase inhibitors etoposide and camptothecin but not the cross-linker mitomycin C. This suggests that HELB responds only to certain types of DNA damage. To investigate the role of HELB in a specific DDR pathway we intend to study the response of HELB to damage caused by the chemotherapeutic alkylators: methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), temozolomide (TMZ), carmustine (BCNU) and the cross-linkers: cisplatin (CDDP), mitomycin C (MITC) and UV-light. MMS and TMZ alkylate both the N7 position of guanine and the N3 position of adenine, while TMZ and BCNU both alkylate the O6 position of guanine. Alkylation of either the N3 position of adenine or the O6 position of guanine is cytotoxic. In addition, since BCNU is a bifunctional alkylator, it can form crosslinks by alkylating two bases. CDDP predominately causes intrastrand guanine-guanine crosslinks while MITC causes intrastrand cross-links between two guanines, and UV-light results in intrastrand thymine-thymine dimers. Typically, damage caused by alkylation is repaired by base excision repair (BER) although cross-links including those caused by BCNU are repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER). Using human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T wild type and HELB knockout cells, we will compare relative concentrations of phosphorylated replication protein A (P33-RPA), a marker of replication stress, produced between each cell line in response to treatment with the various drugs via western blots (WB). A WB performed after treatment with 5mM hydroxyurea suggested more P33-RPA produced in the HELB-KO cells. This will allow us to determine the types of DNA repair in which HELB is involved.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The formation of hairpin structures is hypothesized to contribute to the expansion of nucleotide repeat tracts, which are mutations associated with the development of many hereditary and anticipative neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Divalent metal cations play important structural roles in DNA molecules. Since the cellular concentration of Mg2+ is higher than other divalent metal cations, it is generally assumed to be the most important divalent metal coordinated to DNA. The binding properties (number of sites n and binding affinity Kd) of Mg2+ to slipped-strand DNA structures is unknown. Since Mg2+ is spectroscopically silent and cannot be observed directly, identification of the divalent metal cation coordination requires substitution of Mg2+ with another metal ion. Here, we replace Mg2+ with Mn2+ since the metals have similar ionic radii. Mn2+ is a paramagnetic metal ion, allowing observation of the metal coordination using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. In this study, DNA hairpins of varying sequence and length were titrated with Mn2+ in buffers containing differing concentrations of NaCl. The concentration of Mn2+ coordinated to the DNA hairpins is calculated from room temperature EPR spectra and fit to the binding curve. The binding properties of Mg2+ to DNA hairpins were indirectly calculated through competitive binding studies with both Mn2+ and Mg2+. DNA hairpins with no stem base-base mismatches have a single Mn2+ binding site. The introduction of base-base mismatches to the hairpin stem allows for the coordination of additional Mn2+ ions, with a larger Kd. In the presence of Mg2+, the stoichiometry of Mn2+ coordination to the DNA hairpins remains the same but with weaker affinity. Calculations show that the Kd for Mg2+ is 20-fold higher than the Kd for Mn2+.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Large contiguous tracts of forested-habitat are important for conservation, and Jack Mountain WMA in southwest Arkansas might serve as an important area for breeding birds. The WMA is actively managed so that open pine, deciduous woodlands, and recently cleared (< 5 years since cutting) areas are present. Point counts were performed to evaluate the species using the WMA and the habitats preferred for breeding. Observers performed ten-minute counts at 100 points located across the WMA, recording all birds that were heard or seen. In addition, habitat surveys were performed within 50m of each point. To evaluate detection probabilities, each point was visited twice. Data were collected over ten weeks from late May through July 2019. Data from counts and habitat surveys were examined to determine species presence, richness, and evenness across habitat types. Fifty-five species of birds from ten different avian orders were identified. Birds found in habitats recently cleared of trees included northern bobwhite, common yellowthroat, field sparrow, and yellow-breasted chat; these species were not found in continuous, deciduous woodlands. The most abundant species found across the WMA was red-eyed vireo, closely followed by yellow-throated vireo and tufted titmouse. Species listed of conservation concern in Arkansas that appear to breed on Jack Mountain WMA, include chimney swift, Eastern whip-poor-will, yellow-billed cuckoo, and wood thrush. Our findings suggest that Jack Mountain is an important breeding location for many species of migratory and resident birds. Management for multiple habitat types is likely to increase the use of Jack Mountain WMA by breeding birds.",Herbivore (Vegetarian),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Systemic suppression of the immune system, specifically T-cell impairment, significantly contributes to GBM development and progression. Recent advances in cancer immunotherapies have shown great promise in alleviating such tumor-associated immunosuppression, namely programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint inhibitors. Regrettably, early clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of checkpoint inhibition in recurrent GBM have rendered only modest improvements in overall survival rates, due partially to insufficient inhibition of AKT-STAT3 pathways which are often dysregulated downstream of hyperactive epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) in GBM. In the current study, we aim to evaluate a newly discovered small molecule inhibitor of AKT-STAT3, honokiol, and its ability to suppress AKT-STAT3 activity in the context of hyperactive EGFR in GBM. Using U87-MG cells that stably overexpress a common hyperactivating mutation of EGFR, EGFRvIII, we have preliminary evidence that honokiol is an effective inhibitor of U87-EGFRvIII cellular migration as a result of its robust AKT-STAT3 pathway suppression. Thus, honokiol may provide a novel means of pharmacological inhibition of AKT-STAT3 hyperactivity in GBM and therefore greater clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in this deadly disease.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer that often strikes young women, particularly minority women in their reproductive years. This cancer has a poor prognosis, mainly due to the lack of effective chemotherapeutic agents. Triple negative breast cancers present an additional problem, in that a histologically subtype can have molecularly different forms.  Studies have shown that histological designated tumors yield different treatment results.  Recently, molecular profiling of a patient’s tumor yielded detection of specific driver genes that resulted in the use of single or combination therapies targeting these driver genes. Basal 2 subtype is one of the most aggressive form of TNBC.  This study examined the molecular profiles of two Basal 2 triple negative breast cancers representing two different African American women in response to treatment with vorinostat. Using a RT2 Profiler PCR gene expression array, vorinostat up-regulated 54 genes and downregulated 3 genes in HCC70 TNBC. In HCC1806 TNBC, 23 genes were upregulated and 38 downregulated. The most significant change in gene expression noted in HCC70 was in CCND2, which is hypermethylated in TNBC. Changes were also noted in SNA12, SERPINE, and TWIST.  In HCC1806, significant changes in gene expression were noted in ABCB1, CCND2, CDKN1C and MMP9. These results clearly demonstrated that there is a differential response to a potential anti-tumor drug by different molecular subtypes.  Up-regulation of CCND2 was observed in both basal 2 cell lines. CCND2 encodes cyclin D2 in which low expression is associated with poor prognosis. Understanding individual differences in cancer driver genes will greatly improve personalized medicine in TNBC.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studdard,NCTR,,Mark E. Hart,NCTR,,,Arkansas State University,,"Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium responsible for the majority of nosocomial infections.  Many strains of S. aureus produce α-toxin, which is a pore-forming cytolytic toxin. However, there has been evidence presented that suggests that α-toxin promotes the formation of biofilm by S. aureus in studies using ex vivo porcine vaginal mucosal tissues.  However, these studies also suggest that α-toxin is not involved in an in vitro biofilm assays involving uncoated polystyrene tissue culture plates and glucose supplemented tryptic soy broth (TSB).  We hypothesized that the reason α-toxin may not be involved in the in vitro biofilm assay is the lack of a human plasma pre-coat. The use of a human plasma pre-coat in in vitro biofilm assays has been shown to produce results that are more consistent and a biofilm that tends to be more luxuriant than assays that did not use a pre-coat.
In this study, biofilm capacity of two different S. aureus strains (LAC and FPR 3757) and their isogenic mutant strains defected in α-toxin production was determined using a microtiter plate biofilm assay.  Strains were grown in either biofilm medium (BFM) or TSB supplemented with 0.2% glucose and in wells either coated or uncoated with human plasma.  Preliminary results suggest that strains have a greater ability to form in vitro biofilm in BFM and with plates pre-coated with human plasma.  However, the involvement of -toxin may be strain dependent as one strain exhibited greater biofilm in the α-toxin mutant strain while the second α-toxin mutant strain exhibited less.  Studies are underway to determine whether -toxin is present in spent media by western analysis and whether the protein is functional by hemolytic activity on rabbit blood.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, it is not clear to what extent—if any—microglia react to neurodegeneration as a result of sevoflurane exposure in perinatal rats. Furthermore, at this age, the microglia are not quiescent but active. This project developed methods to determine microglia size in regions where Fluoro-Jade C identified neurodegeneration, as well as whether the relationship between vasculature interactions with microglia was altered. PND 7 perinatal rats were exposed to 6 hours of sevoflurane-induced anesthesia under fully oxygenated conditions. They were then transcardially perfused, and slices were obtained using a cryostat. Microglia were identified using antibodies to allograft inflammatory factor (Aifl, a.k.a. Iba1), while regions of neurodegeneration were determined using Fluoro-Jade C. Rat endothelial antigen 1 (RECA-1) was used to identify vasculature endothelium.

S. aureus is a major inhabitant of the mucous membranes and skin of approximately 30% of humans and thus is a prevalent member of both community-associated and hospital-acquired infections.
Previously, Iverson et al. (2011) used two related strains of S. aureus V8 (ATCC 27733 and ATCC 49755) to demonstrate a significant difference in lethality when mice, previously inoculated with a sub-lethal dose of influenza, were inoculated with these strains. Mice inoculated with S. aureus 49755 exhibited a lethality of 80% while S. aureus 27733 exhibited a lethality of 20%.
Because of their genomic similarities, differences in lethality, and previous studies that suggest an important role for α-toxin in staphylococcal pneumonia, we set about assessing α-toxin expression in these strains.  Genomic DNA and spent media were isolated from these strains at various times of growth.  PCR confirmed the presence of the α-toxin gene (hla) in both strains.  Protein profiles, determined by SDS-PAGE, were different between strains and western analysis demonstrated the presence of α-toxin for 27733 whereas α-toxin for 49755 was barely detectable if at all.  A semi-quantitative hemolytic assay using rabbit blood agar showed greater activity with 27733 than with 49755.  In addition, spectral counts from proteins isolated from spent media at 3 and 12 hours of growth, resolved by one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrometry indicate greater quantities of α-toxin for 27733 than for 49755.  Collectively, these data indicate that α-toxin may not be the critical component for the lethality differences between 27733 and 49755 observed in the influenza mouse model of pneumonia.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pan-genomes can be used to investigate population structures, and they are used frequently to analyze bacterial populations. Many software tools have been developed for pan-genome construction, and they can be broadly separated by their use (or non-use) of sequence alignment methods. The use of alignment-free sequence comparison methods has increased as more genomes have become available because alignment-free methods are able to process larger amounts of data in a shorter amount of time when compared to existing sequence alignment methods. To construct a pan-genome using alignment-free methods, protein sequences must be converted to vector representations. Sequences are analyzed by counting and recording the occurrence of all subsequences of length k (k-mers), and a vector of k-mer frequencies is created to represent each sequence. To optimize the speed of pan-genome construction, we are developing a novel gene representation method that converts gene sequences into vector representations that encode biochemical attributes of each gene sequence. In our methodology, proteins from each genome will be represented by vectors of specific amino acid k-mer frequencies such as the top 3 most occurrent 4-mers, the top 3 most occurrent 4-mers containing polar amino acids, etc. We are testing multiple gene representation criteria to create specific, low-dimensional vectors that will aid protein similarity calculations for rapid pan-genome construction.

Since 3D-SDAR operates in an abstract space of chemical shifts and distances, tools designed to map specific locations of the 3D-SDAR space onto the standard Cartesian coordinates of chemical structures. The recurring patterns can then be generalized in the form of toxophores or pharmacophores.  However, as a novel approach 3D-SDAR is at a stage that requires significant efforts to develop the software base needed for model interpretation. A Matlab code visualizing a 3D-SDAR map of the most important regions contributing either positively or negatively to activity was developed. The map is color coded by frequency of occurrence and freely rotatable along the X, Y and Z coordinates. It allows selection of specific voxels and subsequently displays a subset of molecules in which a specific structural pattern is present. Various statistical parameters such as TP, TN, FP, FN, etc., could be calculated for each subset of molecules satisfying  the boundary conditions.

In particular, drugs of the psychostimulant class such as Methamphetamine (METH) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) have grown increasingly popular in recent years. The adverse effects of METH and MDMA include hyperthermia and can affect the central nervous system as and peripheral organs. When these psychostimulants produce hyperthermia, elevated serum cytokine levels can perturbate muscle tissue and cause liver injury. Liver damage can further increase cytokine levels, immune system activation and increase oxidative stress. With their neurotoxic profile and ability to cause vital organ injury, no FDA-approved therapies are available to counteract the particular side effects associated with METH or MDMA. Our laboratory developed an antibody-fusion fragment that works as a pharmacokinetic antagonist. The fusion fragment sequesters METH in the bloodstream and alters its distribution from reaching the brain. To facilitate systemic delivery to aid in a relapse prevention program, we packaged these sequences into adeno-associated virus (AAV) particles to make AAV-7F9-Fc.
 	We conducted a study to measure the proinflammatory cytokines Tumor Necrosis Factor-, Interleukin-1, and Interleukin-6 via quantitative Real Time-PCR after METH or MDMA administration in mice with and without prior AAV-7F9-Fc administration. Rectal probes were used to measure core body temperature 1h prior and post administration of the psychostimulants. Liver function was further assessed by measuring ALT and bilirubin levels in serum from all mice. Our results indicate that our antibody gene therapy treatment option could mitigate increases in core body temperature and prevented liver associated increases in ALT and bilirubin from MDMA. Taken together these results indicate that our AAV-7F9-Fc treatment does not adversely affect the liver and is effective in preventing psychostimulant liver insult in our rodent model.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their small size, discoid shape and diverse granular content was forged by evolution to orchestrate the hemostatic and thrombotic pathways. Recently emerging evidence suggests the platelet is capable of participating in not only coagulation but the process of inflammation. Since thrombosis and inflammation often occur in tandem, it is unsurprising that certain participants should overlap, as the platelet appears to be a nexus leading to the linkage of these pathophysiological responses. Our lab has previously described the ability of the platelet receptor GPIb-IX, a critical complex for maintaining hemostasis, to modulate the immune phenotype during the systemic inflammatory response elicited by sepsis. The platelet-dependent GPIb-IX physical interaction with neutrophils and monocytes during sepsis has been documented by flow cytometry and image stream analysis.  The consequences of the GPIb-IX-dependent platelet and leukocyte interactions include a reduction in neutrophil activation, expansion of the non-classical monocyte population and a significant rise in circulating cytokines such as TNF. To further document the platelet-dependent consequences on neutrophil activation and migration, we are performing Western blot analysis of elastase levels in major organs following the induction of sepsis.  Our analysis compared wild-type mice to mice with absent GPIb-IX. As the number of individuals affected by sepsis in the US is estimated to be 1.7 million annually, understanding the mechanisms promoting disease progression becomes imperative.

The biopolymers used are expensive and can prove costly to incorporate into prepared materials. In light of this, the overall goal of this research is to develop cost-effective, biomimetic polymers for use as wound healing materials. 
In recognition of the elegant designs of natural polymers and the role they play in wound healing, we have added functional groups to a poly(vinyl alcohol) backbone to create a biomimetic polymer for use in biomedical applications.  Significant functional moieties found in hyaluronic acid and dermatan sulfate were selected for attachment via organic coupling reactions.  The attachment of the functional groups was confirmed through the use of nuclear magnetic resonance. Electrospinning of the synthesized biomimetic polymer yields novel nanofiber scaffolds, and it is anticipated that the inclusion of these functional groups in the scaffold via the biomimetic polymer will allow it to influence wound healing similarly to the original biomolecules. The prepared biomimetic poly(vinyl alcohol) nanofiber constructs will be compared to hyaluronic acid and dermatan sulfate nanofiber mats to observe cellular responses. We believe that the use of biomimetic scaffolds such as these will lead to a better understanding of wound healing and tissue regeneration.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NFPE is a component of nutrition assessment providing dietitians with information to determine nutrition status and degree of malnutrition. Six clinical characteristics used to identify malnutrition are energy intake, weight loss, subcutaneous fat loss, muscle loss, fluid accumulation, and reduced function status. Each has a threshold for identification of well-nourished, mild-moderate malnutrition and severe-malnutrition Sixteen percent of the U.S. population is over 65 years of age and up to 1 out of 2 have malnutrition; therefore, seniors were chosen as the subjects for this study. Thirty-four free-living adults attending the Arkadelphia Senior Center were assessed by two Ouachita Baptist University senior dietetic majors using the NFPE and they completed a 24-hour dietary recall. Results were calculated using Nutritionist Pro®, Excel® and SPSS®. Thirty-three of the 34 subjects met the criteria for mild/moderate and severe malnutrition. Results revealed 32% had muscle loss in the acromion/scapular region, 44% in the clavicle, 53% in the temple, and 59% in the dorsal hand. Six percent had subcutaneous fat loss in the thoracic/lumbar region, 44% in the upper arm, and 79% in the orbital region. Lower body muscle loss was 41% in the patellar/anterior thigh region and 15% in the posterior calf muscle. Thirty-five percent had edema in the lower extremities.

The improvements in treatment methods such as combination chemotherapy, has led to an increase in survivorship by 60% over the past three decades. However, cancer survivors that undergo chemotherapeutic treatment often have peripheral neuropathy. This is termed chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (or CIPN). The symptoms of CIPN may ultimately lead to debilitating limitations in the routine daily living activities such as cooking, walking, driving, dressing, writing, and leisure activities. The risk of developing CIPN is higher with higher doses, multiple courses, and combination chemotherapy. Docetaxel, Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (TAC) are commonly combined and used as an effective treatment for breast cancer. The aim of this study to understand how the TAC impacts motor coordination and characterize how molecular pathways in the cerebellum are affected after treatment. 6-month-old female mice were given four intraperitoneal injections of TAC. Four weeks later, the mice underwent motor coordination testing and brains were collected for analysis. To determine whether the licking frequency distributions of each group differed from each other, we calculated several statistical parameters that characterize interlick intervals over a 90‐min recording sessions.  Total RNA was extracted from cerebellar tissue with the AllPrep RNA extraction kit.  Quantitative analysis of gene expression was performed on the RT2 Profile PCR Array matrix “Synaptic Plasticity” using a dedicated set of reagents from SABiosciences. 6 genes were found to be exponentially upregulated in the TAC groups when compared to the control. Genes of interest were validated using single gene RT-qPCR revealing Nos1 being significantly upregulated.

Epidemiological studies have indicated that breast cancer risk is lower in obese, premenopausal women; by contrast, obesity is positively associated with higher breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. The mechanism for the paradoxical inverse relationship between breast cancer risk and obesity in premenopausal women is unknown. The objective of research in our laboratory is to define the early steps that derail the normal growth of breast epithelial cells, leading to abnormal proliferation and progressing to tumorigenesis. To address whether obesity and breast adiposity exhibit distinct effects on breast epithelial biology, we collected breast tissue from premenopausal non-obese (NO, BMI<30) and obese (O, BMI>30) women with no breast cancer and undergoing breast reduction surgery at the Department of Surgery.  Breast glandular tissue of O vs. NO women were analyzed for gene expression by QPCR, and for protein levels in formalin-fixed breast tissue sections by immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies. The expression levels of genes associated with steroid hormone signaling [estrogen receptor (ER)-α and -β, progesterone receptor (PR)-total and PR isoform-B, Kruppel-like factor (KLF)-4 and -9]; inflammation (interleukin -6 and -8); apoptosis (BcL-2, Bax); tumor suppression (PTEN, p53) and promotion (Notch-1) and cellular proliferation (Cyclin D1) were evaluated. Levels of IL-6 (p=.013), IL-8 (p=.035), BAX (p=.002), Notch-1 (p=.03), ER-α (p=.04), ER-β (p=.038) and KLF-9 (p=.0001) genes were higher for NO than O women, while those for PR and PR-B tended to be higher for O than NO women. The analyses of PTEN, KLF9 and PGR protein levels are ongoing. Our findings suggest that obesogenic status and breast adiposity may have early effects on breast glandular tissue of premenopausal women that may drive susceptibility to tumorigenesis.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main outcome of NAFLD is the progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in some individuals. Therefore, it is critical to identify NAFLD patients with risk to develop NASH in the early stages of the disease.   NAFLD is characterized by a broad spectrum of pathophysiological and molecular abnormalities, among which the role of epigenetic alterations is still poorly understood.  We investigated the role of histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in NAFLD induced by a high-fat and high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet in genetically-diverse Collaborative Cross mice.  Feeding an HF/HS diet for 12 weeks resulted in the development of liver steatosis, an early stage of NAFLD, in the majority of strains that was accompanied by a decrease in H4K16ac and HK27ac levels.  The loss of H4K16ac and H3K27ac was variable between sexes and individual mouse strains, with the greatest effect being found in male mice. To investigate an association between a loss of H4K16ac and H3K27and metabolic traits related to hepatic NAFL phenotype, we measured hepatic triacylglycerols, cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoproteins, and expression of lipid metabolism genes.   A Spearman rank correlation analysis showed an association between H4K16ac and H3K27ac and expression of several genes, among which a negative correlation of H4K16ac and H3K27ac with the expression of the growth differentiation factor 15 (Gdf15) gene, a marker of fibrosis development, and a positive correlation with the expression of histone H4K16 deacetylase Sirt3 were the strongest in male mice. In conclusion, our results suggest that an HF/HS diet can impact hepatic histone acetylation, suggesting that these chromatin modifications are metabolically sensitive and may be related to the development and progression of NAFLD.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The products of collagen- and chitosan-based electrospun materials have exhibited favorable conditions for wound healing, such as prevention of infections and stimulation of cell growth. Electrospinning is applicable in the biomedical field because it can produce a non-woven fibrous scaffold that is flexible enough to conform to many shapes and sizes and also has a high surface-to-volume ratio. An advantage of using chitosan is that is has antimicrobial properties, which is useful in creating a wound dressing. Some benefits of using collagen in biomedical applications is that it is biodegradable, biocompatible, and weakly antigenic. However, collagen, a protein in the body that provides the skin with structure, is very expensive. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop a cost-effective bioresponsive mimic of collagen-based electrospun wound dressings.
We have functionalized poly(acrylic acid) with substituents like those that are found in collagen. This was accomplished via coupling of functional groups and the product was examined using NMR spectroscopy to confirm attachment and to determine the percent -modification that each reaction achieved. The biomimetic-PAA was then electrospun with other polymers to make a fiber mat. In future studies, these fiber mats will be analyzed via the in vitro degradation of the fiber mats and compared to collagen containing fiber mats to test cellular responses. While comparing the fiber mats, the cytotoxicity, cell adhesion, and other features of cells cultured on the nanofibers that were engineered in this research will also be investigated.  It is anticipated that our products will help lead to a wound dressing that is very similar in structure and morphology of the extracellular matrix, but also less expensive than a collagen-based dressing.",Herbivore (Vegetarian),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carlton,NCTR,,Steven Foley,NCTR,,"Many members of the Enterobacteriaceae carry plasmids, such as incompatibility group (Inc) I1 plasmids that encode virulence and antimicrobial resistance that allow strains to survive in diverse conditions.  Carriage of plasmids can lead to increased fitness costs, which is evidenced by diminished growth rates; however, the cost associated with IncI1 plasmids is unclear.  This study evaluated the impact of carriage of IncI1 plasmids, alone or in combination with additional plasmids on Escherichia coli.  Twenty-two transconjugant strains were developed by transferring plasmids from Salmonella isolates into E. coli J53.  IncI1 plasmids were typed by multilocus sequencing typing (pMLST) and transconjugants were evaluated by PCR to determine plasmid content.  Growth curves were generated for each transconjugant and J53 by seeding four wells of a 96-well microtiter plate with each strain and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 18 hr in a Spectramax 384 Plus plate reader.  Absorbance reading at 600 nm were taken every 30 min and exported to Microsoft Excel for analyses, with each set of experiments repeated.  Of the transconjugants, 12 strains carried the IncI1 plasmid alone, 10 strains also carried an IncA/C plasmid, including one that positive for an IncW plasmid.  pMLST indicated that there were 10 different sequence types, with ST26 being most common (n=9).  The strains with growth rate higher than E. coli J53 carried both IncI1 and A/C plasmids, while those with the lowest growth rates had only the IncI1 plasmid. This study assessed the impact of plasmid carriage.  Interestingly, some transconjugants carrying both IncI1 and A/C plasmids had a fitness benefit, while those with the highest fitness cost carried only IncI1 plasmids.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individuals with epilepsy are screened with a Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE) questionnaire to quantify their fulfillment in life. The Social Functioning subsection of the QOLIE assesses person with epilepsy’s satisfaction with their ability to be involved in social situations. The self-reported scores on the Social Functioning section of the QOLIE were compared to the performance on the Verbal Paired Associates (VPA) tests which assess verbal memory. The social functioning is better predicted by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) than by performance on the VPA task. The relationship between social functioning and BDI is a highly significant negative relationship (p<.001, correlation= -.508), whereas there was only a marginal relationship between VPA Recognition and perceived social functioning (p<.071). A significant difference was found when the social functioning population was divided with a median split into high functioning and low functioning groups. A one way ANOVA comparison revealed the mean of the Low social functioning group (32.2± 4.0) to be significantly lower (F1, 38=8.58; p<0.006) than the mean of the high social functioning group (38.1 ± 2.0). When BDI and BAI were accounted for using a linear regression the relationship between the low social functioning group and the high social functioning group was still significant (F1,35=7.04; p<0.012).",Herbivore (Vegetarian),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tristian Wiles,Hendrix College,,,Arkansas State University,,,Arkansas State University,,"The bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga is a microinvertebrate with a highly efficient DNA repair system that allows individuals to recover from DNA damage caused by desiccation or ionizing radiation. In this study, the bdelloid DNA repair mechanism was investigated via two methods: yeast two-hybrid analysis and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. First, yeast two-hybrid screening was utilized to identify interactions between a candidate DNA repair protein –the bait protein– and other proteins expressed in A. vaga –the prey proteins. Identifying interacting proteins will provide insight into the cellular functions of candidate proteins during DNA repair. To produce a library of prey proteins, cDNAs representing the full complement of A. vaga proteins were cloned into plasmids and transformed into yeast. Three yeast bait strains that each expressed a different candidate DNA repair protein were mated with the prey library to screen for bait-prey interactions. However, screening of over 400 putative bait-prey interactions suggested that all prey plasmids lacked inserts. These false positives show that A. vaga cDNAs were inefficiently cloned into plasmids in the prey library, necessitating the future optimization of library creation. Second, a method for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in A. vaga was developed. If successful, this method could serve as a tool for eliciting the phenotypic knockdown of candidate DNA repair genes in bdelloids. Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for the A. vaga PolyADP-ribose Polymerase (PARP) and Calmodulin-like (CAL) genes were created and incubated with the Cas9 enzyme to form sgRNA-Cas9 complexes. These sgRNA-Cas9 complexes were transfected into A. vaga via electroporation, and T7 endonuclease assays were performed to identify subsequent mutations in the PARP and CAL genes. Once perfected, these two methods of investigating the roles of candidate genes stand to elucidate the mechanism behind the extraordinary DNA repair in A. vaga.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The VNO is connected to the nasal cavity and contains sensory neurons that detect inhaled pheromones. The sensory neurons of the VNO are derived from the olfactory placode which forms on the surface of the embryo and invaginates to form the nasal cavity. The VNO proper separates from the rest of the nasal cavity beginning around embryonic day (E) 10.5 when it invaginates toward the nasal septum. Little is known about the genetic regulation of the invagination process or the specification of neural stem cells in this organ. Preliminary work in our lab found that the delta like non-canonical notch ligand 1 (Dlk1) gene is expressed in a ventral subset of cells in the developing VNO at E10.5. This pattern of expression suggests that it may be involved in either the invagination of the epithelium or the specification of neural stem cells during VNO development. To determine if the Dlk1 gene is required for the normal development of the VNO, we obtained mice that contain a null allele of the Dlk1 gene and examined the development of the VNO in Dlk1 knockouts. We have found that the VNO invaginates properly in the absence of Dlk-1 function in the knockout embryos, and the development of VNO sensory neurons appears normal. We are currently characterizing migratory gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons to determine if Dlk-1 is required for the development of these cells.

One particular method developed for yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), CRISPEY (Cas9 Retron Precise Parallel Editing via Homology), has been found to make more precise edits by utilizing reverse transcriptase to more precisely integrate genes into the host DNA. Previous uses of CRISPEY fully integrated the gene for the Cas9 protein into the genome of yeast. While this method is useful for ensuring the Cas9 protein remains in the host, it makes removing the Cas9 protein from that strain of yeast difficult if a Cas9-free control is needed further down the line. In addition, it makes it much more difficult to use this method of CRISPR on wild strains of yeast that don't have the Cas9 gene already integrated. Using cloning, I assembled a plasmid containing the Cas9 and retron templates, as well as a plasmid containing the knockout mutant of the ADE2 gene. This knockout will disrupt the biosynthesis of adenine, causing an accumulation of a red intermediate in the yeast. This enables a rapid assessment of CRISPR efficiency by counting and comparing the number of red colonies per transformation. Both plasmids were then transformed into a haploid and diploid strain of yeast in order to determine if there were any significant differences in CRISPR reaction efficiency. Ongoing studies will test the reaction efficiency of the CRISPEY plasmid in order to determine if it is a viable option for editing both wild and known lab strains of yeast.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Freshly isolated mitochondria were treated with KIs at concentrations normalized to the maximal blood concentrations (Cmax), and then oxidative phosphorylation was assessed by oxygen consumption using a Clark-type electrode. It was found that 6 KIs caused either significant inhibition of state 3 respiration or remarkable increases in state 4 respiration, indicating these drugs are either respiratory chain inhibitors or uncouplers. A notable finding is that regorafenib caused almost complete uncoupling at concentrations of 2-fold Cmax, and its two pharmacologically active metabolites M2 and M5, whose blood levels are the same as regorafenib, were remarkably less toxic to the mitochondria, indicating that regorafenib cardiotoxicity is likely mainly associated with the parent drug but not the metabolites.

In Cnidaria, a new neuropeptide known as RPamide likely emerged in the sea anemone lineage and may illuminate the evolutionary history of the Cnidarian nervous system. RPamide differs from ancient families of neuropeptides such as GLWamide and RFamide which both may be evolutionarily conserved among Cnidaria and the sister group Bilateria and are thought to regulate life cycle transitions in cnidarian metamorphosis. Instead, RPamide is restricted to sea anemone (anthozoan) cnidarians, has different developmental expression patterns, and has a function that is not well characterized. We find that through in situ hybridization and immunostaining that RPamide expression specifically occurs in ectodermal epithelial cells in the aboral region during the process of gastrulation, suggesting the possibility that RPamide regulates development of the aboral apical organ, a putative sensory structure of the free-swimming planula for metamorphosis. To investigate the function of RPamide neuropeptides, we utilized CRISPR-Cas9 technology to knockout the RPamide precursor gene. The analysis of F0 RPamide mutants shows slower rates of metamorphosis relative to the control, suggesting that RPamides may be necessary for the temporal regulation of life cycle transition. Ongoing studies will attempt to rescue knockout phenotypes by treating F0 mutants with synthetic RPamides in order to confirm that slower rates of metamorphosis observed in F0 RPamide mutants are indeed due to the absence of RPamide, and not due to off-target effects of genome editing.",Omnivore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
