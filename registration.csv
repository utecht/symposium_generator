However, their biosynthesis and functions remain highly debated. In tumors, eccDNA can act as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and can amplify oncogenes to drive tumorigenesis and drug resistance, but their purpose in noncancerous cells is largely undetermined. Purifying and sequencing eccDNA is thus a critical prerequisite in order to better understand their biogenesis, function, and impact on phenotype. This study specifically examines eccDNA in noncancerous bone cells using the MLO-Y4, MLO-A5, UAMS32, and ST2 cell lines. We first isolate total DNA from the cells before employing the developed eccDNA enrichment method using exonuclease V for initial linear DNA removal, then restriction enzyme cutting for extraneous circular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) removal. We subsequently perform rolling circle amplification, sequencing using Oxford Nanopore MinION flow cell, and analysis using the CReSIL bioinformatics tool to characterize the eccDNA for comparison across the different bone cell lines. The latter portion of this study shifts to an in vivo examination of eccDNA using mouse bone. The overarching goal of this project is to provide a novel investigation of eccDNA in noncancerous bone cells and to further promote the discussion of its potential applications and functions.",Omnivore,6/28/23 22:57,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,P1,,P1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although ICIs have revolutionized the management of metastatic melanoma, only 50% of patients exhibit immunotherapy responsiveness. Therefore, identifying the hallmarks of ICI responsiveness is needed to advance and improve clinical outcomes. Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) is an antigen presentation protein critical to the immune surveillance and recognition of cancer cells. Resistance to ICI therapy is correlated with downregulated MHC-I antigen presentation genes, decreased T-cell mediated killings, and increased oxidative metabolism. To investigate the mechanisms behind the pathways of responsiveness, B16-F10 mouse melanoma cell lines were cultured under conditions of prolonged metabolic stress. Removing glucose from the media forces melanoma cells to adapt to galactose supplementation, increasing levels of oxidative metabolism, and replicating the metabolic stress and harsh conditions of a tumor microenvironment. Proteomic analysis confirmed that the metabolically adapted cells successfully recreate the ICI responder phenotype. In addition, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) was found to increase in the galactose-adapted cells. ATF6 is a sensor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that initiates the unfolded protein response, which combats ER stress in highly burdened cells. Histone modifying enzymes were also found to be dysregulated, specifically EZH2, a histone methyltransferase that is involved in regulation of MHC-I antigen presentation. To investigate the regulation of MHC-I and ICI response, ATF6 and EZH2 mutant cell lines were established and combined with activated CD8+ T-cells to provide insight into the mechanisms of tumor killing  under conditions of high ER stress and/or transcriptional regulation",Omnivore,7/5/23 19:51,,Black or African American,,,,,,,,,,,Some Other Race,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,,P2,P2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to various gastrointestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and colorectal cancer which has been labeled as the third leading cause of cancer deaths according to the American Cancer Society. Research has shown that a common detection with these gastrointestinal diseases is an increase in E. coli population, more specifically colibactin-producing E. coli strains. Colibactin is a genotoxin that is mainly produced by E. coli and is known to target bacteria containing prophage thus triggering phage production. The objective of this study was to isolate and characterize new bacteriophages that have antimicrobial activity against colibactin-producing E. coli. Sources such as beef products, wastewater, and spinach are known to contain an E. coli population, thus becoming the sources that were chosen for this research. Twelve wastewater samples, twenty-eight beef samples, and fifteen spinach samples were screened for the presence of target bacteriophages. Attacking the host cells using bacteriophages through spot-on-lawn assays has been the methodology used to inspect two colibactin-producing E. coli strains (NC101, SP15) and one quality control strain, E. coli ATCC 25922 in this project. Currently, one beef sample and 12 wastewater samples mixed with a combination of E. coli strains against different host cells were tested to contain bacteriophages.

Synthetic cannabinoids mimic the “high” from cannabis, and yet they pose significant health risks such as psychosis, seizures, hallucinations, and death. While this issue alone is worrisome, the problem becomes even more pronounced when synthetic cannabinoids are taken with other drugs. Evidence of drug mixtures are shown by combinations found in clinical and pathology reports. Those combinations can cause drug-drug interactions between them leading to unexpected, elevated doses that increase adverse effects. Sadly, despite its likely common occurrence, there exists little reliable data in place that can accurately predict the significance of drug-drug interactions for synthetic cannabinoids. Drug combinations are more probable for those with mental health disorders, who are also prone to substance use disorders. Drug-drug interactions then result when those drugs compete for the same metabolizing enzymes. Consequently, we hypothesize that the antipsychotic olanzapine will inhibit metabolism of the synthetic cannabinoid 5F-APINACA. Both drugs have been found in combination in drug abusers and they undergo metabolism by the same CYP3A4 enzyme. We are testing this hypothesis by carrying out metabolic reactions using human liver microsomes and analyzing them by HPLC. Preliminary studies have shown that when Olanzapine is added to 5F-APINACA, enzymatic activity decreases and substrate binding affinity decreases.  Once complete, these studies will provide valuable data that will serve as a foundation to conduct more advanced studies over the topic of drug-drug interaction.",Omnivore,7/10/23 11:56,,,,,,,,Multiracial,,,,,,,Multiracial,Male,,Male,,,,,,,P5,,P5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given this recent growth, the need to define telehealth has become important for various audiences (e.g., practitioners, policymakers, insurers). This scoping review examines the current use of definitions related to telehealth.
Methods: A scoping review was conducted to answer three key research questions regarding telehealth-related definitions: 1) What issues and challenges exist with current telehealth definitions, especially the terms “telehealth” and “telemedicine” in the U.S.? 2) What are the current telehealth definitions used among U.S. stakeholders and across the healthcare literature? 3) What are key considerations when selecting telehealth definitions that are the right fit for services or programs provided? 
Results: Differences exist in how the academic literature, organizations, and legislation use the terms “telehealth” and “telemedicine,” either interchangeably or as distinct terms (60% of academic literature, 76% of organizations, and no legislative documents defined them as distinct terms). Eighty percent of the scoped entities provided a specific definition for telehealth. Similarly, 80% percent of the entities had a telemedicine definition, out of which 50% of them represented telemedicine as having a clinical care focus, while the other half included activities other than clinical care, such as continuing medical education or administrative processes. 
Conclusions: Existing telehealth definitions vary considerably across sources due to differences in intended audience and purpose. Overall, clarity and communication will be improved by using the more-encompassing term “telehealth” over the term “telemedicine” and including three key components within telehealth definitions: 1) Service (what is being delivered?), 2) Structure (how is it being delivered?), and 3) Purpose (why is it being delivered?).",Omnivore,7/5/23 10:20,,Black or African American,,,,,,,,Black or African-American alone,,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,,P6,P6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bdelloid rotifers, however, are an exception. These microscopic, aquatic animals possess unique DNA repair capabilities that allow them to survive desiccation. Their DNA repair mechanism is unusually efficient and not yet understood. In other eukaryotes, chromatin - specifically histone proteins - plays a key role in DNA repair. Bdelloids have seven histone H2A proteins with longer C-terminal tails than in other animals, so these proteins are good candidates for having a role in DNA repair. The objective of this project is to determine which bdelloid histone H2A proteins are likely involved in DNA repair. First, to identify polyadenylated histone mRNAs, 3’ random amplification of cDNA ends (3’ RACE) was used to sequence 3’ UTRs of histone genes in the bdelloid Adineta vaga. Transcripts with poly-A tails likely represent histone variants that might regulate DNA repair. Next, the function of histone H2A proteins H2Abd and H2Abd1 in A. vaga were investigated by using CRISPR genome editing to inactivate the genes. Single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) designed to excise each gene were first tested using an in vitro Cas9 cleavage assay. A DNA template was also designed to replace each histone gene with the GFP gene during homology-directed repair. CRISPR was carried out by electroporating rotifer embryos with the sgRNA/Cas9 complexes and the GFP repair template. Fluorescence microscopy was used to find evidence of genome editing via GFP expression in rotifers. Once a histone mutant is identified, CRISPR will be used to inactivate histone H2A genes that are potentially involved in DNA repair. Mutant rotifers will be desiccated to cause DNA damage, then rehydrated to induce DNA repair. Ultimately, a reduced recovery rate in mutant rotifers relative to wild type rotifers would suggest that the targeted histone H2A gene has an important role in DNA repair.",Omnivore,7/5/23 16:00,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,P7,,P7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although HELB is known to be crucial for genomic maintenance, preliminary data identified several sites of phosphorylation on the protein that reduce its enzymatic activity when phosphorylated. However, the effects of phosphorylating individual residues are unknown. In order to investigate the effects of phosphorylation on serine 1048 (S1048) of HELB, we created a plasmid with a serine to aspartic acid mutation (S1048D) to mimic the effects of phosphorylation. We have developed a protocol to express and purify HELB from E. coli, and DNA unwinding assays with the purified wild type HELB confirmed that active enzyme was produced. We are currently purifying the S1048D HELB variant whose activity we will compare to the activity of wild type HELB in order to discover how phosphorylation of this specific site affects HELB activity in vitro. Preliminary data suggests that the phosphorylation of HELB at six residues, including S1048, decreases its activity, and that the S1048 residue is one of the most phosphorylated sites in human HELB. Thus, we expect reduced DNA unwinding assay of the purified S1048D HELB variant relative to the wild type HELB. Discovering the activity of this HELB variant and others will provide valuable information that can be used to predict the effect of HELB phosphorylation on its activities within the cell.",Omnivore,7/5/23 16:09,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,P11,,P11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most of the ZnO nanostructure synthesis methods use toxic chemicals, are expensive, complicated, and non-scalable. Besides that, ZnO photocatalysts are often synthesized in powder form, which are suspended in water. Although suspended nanostructures have high surface area, their recovery and reuse are challenging, and may cause secondary pollution. Hence, there is a need for synthesizing robust nanostructured photocatalysts that are immobilized on supports, in a scalable, cost – effective and environmentally friendly way, for water disinfection applications. Here we introduce a simple and chemical- free nanostructure synthesis method using a hot water treatment (HWT) to produce immobilized metal oxide nanostructures.  In this work, we immersed Zn plates in DI water at 75C for different time durations, which resulted in the formation of ZnO nanostructures of different lengths and diameters. Morphology and crystal structure of the ZnO nanostructures were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and X–ray diffraction. We then tested the antimicrobial efficacy of these novel nanostructured surfaces and coupled this surface treatment with UV radiation. It was found that the nanostructured ZnO plates had a statistically significant antimicrobial effect, and increased kill when coupled with UV radiation. This is believed to be due to the increased formation of ROS due to the photocatalytic ZnO nanostructures.",Omnivore,7/5/23 14:57,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,,P12,P12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is true for both men and women, in the United States and for the state of Arkansas as well. Nearly half of colorectal cancer cases are associated with a mutation in the oncogene KRAS. Both chemotherapy and radiation therapy can be used, but patients with the KRAS-mutated (KRASmut) cancer cells do not usually respond well to the treatment. These activated-KRAS mutations make it difficult for any treatment to work properly, as the tumor cells display a high resistance. From previous research in our lab, existing literatures, and with the help of proteomics data collected here at UAMS, it is evident that KRAS mutated cancer cells are highly dependent on methionine, which is an essential amino acid. We also know that KRAS contributes to the metabolic pathway NRF2 and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our hypothesis is that reducing the intake of methionine would re-sensitize the KRAS mutant cells, and hence forth making them more susceptible to treatment. Therefore, the goal of our project is to confirm that the KRAS pathway is increased in the tumors from mice that were fed a diet low in methionine, while also looking at related proteins, and comparing them to the results from growing the same cancer cells in the lab in vitro.",Omnivore,7/3/23 15:17,,Black or African American,,,,,,,,Black or African-American alone,,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,P13,,P13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meiotic recombination is clustered at “hotspots” that are irregularly distributed across the genome. To further elucidate how discrete DNA sequences direct hotspots, we are using the CRISPR gene-editing system to introduce specific sequences into the model organism Schizosaccharomyces pombe.  We have incorporated two previously identified DNA motifs, called HES92 and HES95, that are potential hotspots into the reporter gene ade6. To accomplish this, we transformed wild-type fission yeast with a plasmid that expresses both the Cas9 endonuclease and a guide RNA that directs it to the desired region of ade6. The plasmid was co-transformed with a short DNA fragment containing the motif of interest flanked by sequences homologous to the target region. Transformants were selected by resistance to the drug G418, as well as screened for red colony color, indicating the successful introduction of mutations to ade6.  The resulting ade6 gene of selected transformants was analyzed by Sanger sequencing.  Out of four candidates sequenced so far, we have confirmed that three contain the intended mutations.

During neonatal development in both rodents and humans, a surge in leptin occurs and is responsible for the proper development of these hypothalamic neurons. However, leptin may also be involved in pituitary development and maturation. Studies have found that maternal undernutrition alters the leptin surge, which may cause metabolic dysfunction and weight gain in adult progeny. Musashi (MSI) is a translational regulator found in the anterior pituitary that inhibits POU1F1, a protein necessary for pituitary cell differentiation and maturation. Previous work in our lab has shown that leptin stimulates pituitary Musashi expression. This study focused on blunting the neonatal leptin surge in FVB mice with a 30% maternal caloric restriction (CR30). We hypothesized that this would alter the expression of MSI targets in neonates, and that these changes would persist in the adult offspring. Adult progenies were fed either a control diet (CTRL) or a 60% high fat diet (HFD) for 25 weeks. Surprisingly, CR30-HFD males had reduced weight (starting at 5 wks, 3.761g less than CTRL-HFD, p<0.05) compared to controls, whereas CR30-HFD females gained more weight than CTRL-HFD as originally expected. Glucose tolerance tests revealed reduced insulin resistance in CR30-HFD males, whereas CR30-HFD females were insulin resistant. CLAMS-Oxymax metabolic cage data revealed that CR30-HFD males had reduced food intake (p<0.0001), reduced energy expenditure (p<0.0001), and reduced ambulation (p<0.0001) in the dark phase. These data suggest that an undernourished maternal environment programs appetite-suppressing mechanisms within male, but not female, offspring.

The treatments used are Sigma Anti-Bonding Calcium Carbonate (SAC) and an herbal treatment of an equal mixture of calcium and selenium supplements. Both treatments show an increase in bone density in individuals with multiple
myeloma, but the herbal treatment shows a higher increase in bone density than the SAC treatment. The Human gut microbiota plays a heavily important role in the progression of myeloma because of the composition of bacteria in the intestines [1]. The micro-organisms in the gut are highly beneficial but under specific conditions [1]. If the microbiome differentiates from those specific conditions, this effect can cause the growth of cancer cells [1]. When the bacteria that thrive from nitrogen-recycling bacteria are increased, mortality rates increase [1]. This is because of the high urea concentrations in patients with multiple myeloma [1]. This high concentration of urea is caused by the increased NH4+ production from tumor cells that, in turn, causes secretions of urea to be decreased, which causes renal function failure [1]. The goal of
this research is to figure out why herbal medicine caused an increase in bone density and if it is related to the gut microbiome and how it is related.

Various members of the poxvirus family possess proteins that affect the mammalian protein, sterile alpha motif protein 9 (SAMD9), to establish cellular infection. Despite the diverse functions of SAMD9, its underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. To unravel the protein’s function, we utilized a rabbit infecting poxvirus, Myxoma virus (MYXV). MYXV consists of a M062 protein that affects the SAMD9 protein found in mammalian cells. The aim of this study is to understand the mode of action of SAMD9 by exploiting the interaction between SAMD9 and MYXV M062 protein. We first generated a mutant MYXV, MAV-M062R and compared it to the wildtype Lu-M062R virus. The mutation in MAV-M062R prevents binding with the SAMD9 protein, resulting in defective viral RNA and protein expression, confirmed through reverse transcriptase, real time PCR and western blot. This defect in viral replication cycle leads to its attenuated infection. The defective viral protein expression revealed the involvement of another cellular protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), whose phosphorylation leads to global translation shutdown in the cell. Our western blot results showed induction of phosphorylation of eIF2α during infection with the mutant virus. We then analyzed the kinase responsible for eIF2α phosphorylation. For this, we assessed the involvement of 2 kinases, PERK and PKR. Our western blot data revealed that p-eIF2α is regulated in a PKR dependent manner. To further confirm this phenotype, we will study PKR KO cells infected with WT and mutant MYXV viruses. We will use western blot to analyze the role of PKR in regulating p-eIF2α during MYXV infection. This connection will enhance our understanding of how the SAMD9 protein contributes to establishing a unique antiviral state within host cells.",Omnivore,7/5/23 22:23,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,P17,,P17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite these advances, cognitive impairment induced by chemotherapy, specifically docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) treatment, is demonstrated in many TNBC patients, manifesting as neuroinflammation, depression, and anxiety. This study evaluates the potential role of CCR2 deletion in mitigating TAC-induced anxiety and cognitive dysfunction.
Methods: Female wildtype (WT) and CCR2-KO mice were administered TAC treatment for 8 weeks, while the control groups received saline. Thirty days post-treatment, the Elevated Plus (EP) and Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests were conducted to assess anxiety-like behavior and spatial memory. To investigate the relationship between CCR2 inactivation and cognitive deficits, QIAGEN and KEGG analysis were utilized to identify significant changes in the proteome correlated with inflammation. 
 Results: In the EP test, the WT TAC mice exhibited a reluctance to explore open arms, indicating chemotherapy’s role in exacerbating anxiety. Conversely, CCR2-KO mice receiving TAC demonstrated reduced anxiety-like behavior compared to the control group and both WT groups, implying that CCR2 deficiency may alleviate TAC-induced anxiety. During the MWM, it was similarly observed that TAC impaired cognitive function of WT mice, while both CCR2-knockout groups were comparatively unaffected and successfully located the target quadrant on Days 3-5. Proteomics analysis revealed that CCR2 inactivation downregulated proteins associated with oxidative stress, potentially mitigating inflammation caused by chemotherapy.
Directions: To ensure the efficacy of CCR2 deletion as a treatment for chemotherapy symptoms, it is imperative to conduct further cognitive and anxiety-like behavioral tests and address the susceptibility to infection instigated by CCR2 deficiency.",Omnivore,7/5/23 1:59,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,,P18,P18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These potent compounds are effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteria. Lead compounds inhibited the growth of bacteria both in planktonic and biofilms context.

We have also found a correlation between the results of the docking study and in vitro study. The compounds which showed low binding energy in the docking study also showed lower minimum inhibitory concentration in the in vitro study against the bacterial strains.

Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are major treatments for breast cancer; however, both cause severe side effects to healthy tissues that lower the patient’s quality of life. Parthenolide (PTL), a sesquiterpene lactone that occurs naturally in the plant feverfew, and gamma-tocotrienol (GT3), a vitamin E family member and a known mevalonate pathway inhibitor that has historically been implicated in cardiovascular disease treatment, have recently garnered interest as potential anticancer agents with minimal side effects. This research aimed to determine if the combined treatment of PTL and GT3 synergistically limit MCF7 breast cancer cell proliferation and elucidate its molecular mechanisms. The synergistic effect of PTL and GT3 against MCF7 breast cancer cell proliferation, clonogenic survival, and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT, colony forming ability, western blot, and flow cytometry. The results of the MTT assay from MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with GT3 (50 µM) and/or PTL (5 µM) for 24 and 48 hours demonstrated that combined treatment suppresses the proliferation rate of MCF7 cells at a greater extent than the singular treatment with either GT3 or PTL at both time points. Colony formation assay results of MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with GT3 (5 µM) and/or PTL (0.5 µM) showed that the inhibition of colony forming ability was greater in the combined treatment groups compared to the singular treatment groups. Western blot results showed increased expression of apoptotic markers, while flow cytometry exhibited a higher percentage of apoptotic cells in combined treatment group (50 M GT3 plus 5 M PTL) as compared to the singular treatment group.

Characteristics of OI include malformed and bowed bones, small stature, easily bruised skin, blue sclera (whites of eyes look blue), and heart or respiratory problems. Perinatal mortality in OI is often the result of respiratory failure. Prior research showed that defects of the skeleton, including rib cage distortions, restrict ventilation, yet not much research has shown if lung intrinsic factors exist and lead to respiratory problems. We previously showed morphological and functional changes in the lungs of OI mouse models. Specifically, OI lungs had enlarged alveolar structures perhaps due to defective alveolar septation compared to WT mouse lungs, resulting in less surface area for gas exchange. We hypothesize that defective type I collagen in lung fibroblasts, cells producing the majority of collagen, will lead to dysregulation of lung alveolar morphogenesis and alteration in mRNA expression level of genes involved in this process. Our goal is to 1) confirm the lung findings in mice with a collagen mutation expressed only in lung tissue, eliminating the possibility for skeletal defects to impact the lung and 2) to analyze cellular and molecular changes in lung of OI mice using single-cell RNA sequencing.

However, the activity of ALT, but not AST, spontaneously decreased by about 50% every 24 h, suggesting ALT activity is not suitable for measuring cell death in liver-chips. In contrast, protein levels of ALT and AST measured by ELISA were stable over time and readily detectable in the effluent of intact cells.

Because it is impossible to obtain critical dose-response and time-course data on anesthetic/analgesic-induced neural damage in human infants or children, the utilization of neural stem cell models, especially cells derived from humans, might be a good tool to evaluate the vulnerability of the nervous system. Since neural cells contain a wide variety of lipid classes and lipid species, lipidomics analysis using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was conducted to investigate the impacts of different dosages of fentanyl on neural cells. The neural cells were treated with vehicle (control) or fentanyl at 1 uM, 10 uM, or 100 uM. In total, 1830 lipid species from 20 lipid classes were detected and identified. Among the detected 20 lipid classes, the total abundance of cholesterol ester and sphingosine classes significantly decreased while ceramide and hexosylceramide classes significantly increased (>2 folds increases) in the high-dose group vs. the control. This preliminary data indicated that the ceramide pathway was disturbed by fentanyl treatments, which might provide the underlying mechanisms of fentanyl-induced neurotoxicity.

While exact mechanisms of neurodegeneration are to be further elucidated upon, Familial AD is largely associated with mutations occuring in the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), resulting in an accumulation of β-Amyloid (Aβ) senile plaque deposits in the hippocampus and basal segments of the brain. The processing and cleaving of APP is confirmedly categorized into two pathways; the Amyloidogenic pathway, facilitated by the β-secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE1), is responsible for the release of non-membrane tethered Aβ into the luminal space. Saturated fatty acids (SFA) are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The presence of intracellular Aβ peptides in neurons derived from transgenic mice propounds a possible greater involvement of intracellular Aβ in the early pathogenesis of AD in T2DM patients, rather than extracellular. This study utilizes Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy in combination with Western Blotting to determine adverse effects of SFA exposure in transfected Neuro2A cells expressing mutant APPSwe/Ind. Such effects may include translocation of the intracellular site of Aβ generation. We will identify possible remediatory effects of two anti-diabetic agents, Metformin and Liraglutide, on the distribution of Aβ within the neuronal cell body. Preliminary results of an analysis performed on images of Neuro2A cells stained with a monoclonal antibody detecting APP indicate that in the absence of SFA, APP accumulates in a trans-Golgi network-like perinuclear compartment. However, upon exposure to palmitate, APP abundance within this compartment is decreased. We seek to determine whether APP is instead increased within the ER, suggesting that in the presence of SFA, APP retention occurs, leading to greater ER stress and neuronal death if not ameliorated.",Omnivore,7/5/23 19:51,White,,,,,,,Hispanic,,,,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,,P28,P28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

G-quadruplexes (G4) are non-canonical DNA structures impacting replication, gene expression, and post-transcriptional events. Efficient resolution and replication of G4 structures are vital to prevent mutations, DNA damage, and cancer. G4 structures arise from guanine bases forming G-tetrads or G-quartets via Hoogsteen-hydrogen bonds. Stacking G-tetrads creates G-quadruplexes (G4). Several proteins and enzymes facilitate DNA replication across G4 structures. Werner protein (WRN), a Rec-Q family helicase involved in DNA maintenance and repair, plays a key role. Werner's syndrome, characterized by rapid aging and increased cancer risk, is associated with over 60 genetic mutations resulting in dysfunctional or shortened WRN protein. Prior studies indicate that loss of functional WRN increases genetic mutation frequency in G4-capable human telomeric regions. This study investigates how WRN aids translesion DNA polymerases in unwinding G4 structures. A polymerase extension assay employed purified human polymerase kappa (PolK) on template-primer DNA substrates capable of forming G4 structures, along with non-G4 DNA substrates as controls. The assay was conducted with and without purified WRN protein, and the results were compared. Findings reveal that WRN helicase significantly enhances PolK's replication across G4 sequences compared to PolK alone. These findings enhance our understanding of the collaborative mechanisms of essential proteins in resolving G4 DNA structures and maintaining genomic stability.",Omnivore,,,Black or African American,,,,,,,,Black or African-American alone,,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,,P118,P118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early life adversity is a well-established risk factor for the development of chronic pain. Early life adversity can be modeled in animals using the neonatal limited bedding model, which alters the pattern of maternal care behaviors and provokes early life stress in the offspring. Epigenetic memory of these altered patterns of maternal touch can then be stored in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) which innervates the skin and contains the cell nuclei for peripheral sensory neurons.  Using this model, we have identified regions of differentially accessible chromatin in the rat DRG which are associated with increased sensitivity to mechanical touch following early life stress.  We hypothesize that these regions may epigenetically prime sensory neurons to regulate sensory transduction pathways and increase an individual's susceptibility for chronic pain later in life. We tested high ranking differentially accessible regions using luciferase assays to determine their regulatory potential.  We cloned each sequence into a luciferase expressing vector and transfected this plasmid into the 50B11 rat immortalized nociceptor cell line. Approximately 48 hours after transfection, we added the luciferase substrate and measured the bioluminesce emitted from each reaction to quantitate a measure of each sequences’ regulatory capabilities.",Omnivore,7/5/23 15:19,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,P29,,P29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kinases can be thought of as traffic signals that regulate the flow of information in a cell. Overexpression or mutation of kinases has been shown to occur in many cancers. Kinases can be inhibited using small molecules that occupy the ATP binding pocket to inhibit the process of phosphorylation. Specifically, protein tyrosine kinase 6 or PTK6 (aka BRK) is currently being investigated in cancers since it is overexpressed in breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers and aids in the proliferation, metastasis, and development of tumor cells.1 Kinase inhibitors that block catalytic activity of BRK have been unsuccessful in clinical trials for treatment of BRK-associated breast cancer suggesting a possible non-catalytic role of BRK in cancer. The non-catalytic mechanism of the kinase can be targeted using proteolysis targeting chimeras or PROTACs. These PROTACS are heterobifunctional molecules with two separate ligands, in which one ligand binds to the target protein, and the other binds to the E3 ubiquitin ligase system. The PROTAC brings the target protein and the E3 ubiquitin ligase system together, so the protein of interest can be ubiquitinated and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.2 Degrading the BRK kinase in this way may be effectively used to fight breast cancer. A PROTAC specific to BRK for its targeted degradation is currently under development. A potent inhibitor of the kinase has already been developed by our laboratory, which will serve as a ligand to bind to the BRK kinase. Now, a second ligand i.e., E3 ligand must be added to the molecule, to mark the kinase for degradation. The synthesized PROTACs will be investigated for proteolytic degradation of BRK.",Omnivore,7/5/23 14:20,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,,P30,P30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hamilton, Ph.D.",Ouachita Baptist University,,,,,"The development of biomimetic materials for use in the human body has been a point of interest for researchers over the past several decades. A prominent process for this is electrospinning because one can spin several components together into a non-woven nanofiber scaffold, similar to the architecture of the extracellular matrix. Polymers such as poly(δ-valerolactone) (PDVL), a biocompatible and biodegradable polyester, and biopolymers such as chitosan, a derivative of chitin known to have antibacterial properties, have been used to make such materials. Our research aimed to develop a collagen analog using a biomimetic PDVL (bPDVL) electrospun with chitosan to make nanofibrous wound dressings. We developed a practical, multi-step synthesis of our monomer, which was then polymerized into a PDVL derivative and modified with amines similar in structure to amino groups found in collagen to produce a bPDVL. Each synthetic step was analyzed using NMR and IR spectroscopies to confirm success. bPDVL/chitosan fiber mats were analyzed via scanning electron microscopy and IR spectroscopy. 
 
Previous studies in the Hamilton lab observed increased hemostatic properties for calcium chloride-treated fiber mats. In the earlier studies, though, the amount of calcium loaded on the scaffolds was unknown. Thus, a quantification method was developed to detect the amount of calcium chloride on the mats so that consistent results on the concentration of loaded calcium chloride could be determined. Additionally, in vitro studies were done on previously made materials to compare the bPDVL fiber mats. In future research, the bPDVL fiber mats will undergo cell and degradation studies to compare to our other fiber mats and similar commercially available products. It is predicted that the mats will help us develop a novel wound dressing that will resemble the extracellular matrix, have antibacterial and hemostatic properties, and be less expensive than a human collagen dressing.",Omnivore,7/5/23 23:07,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,P31,,P31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transactions) is a highly conserved histone chaperone complex, made of Spt16 and Pob3 in S. cerevisiae, that aids in the disassembly of chromatin so that RNA polymerases can carry out transcription. Our previous research identified a region on nucleosomes known as the ISGI (Influences Spt16-Gene Interactions) region, which is necessary for proper dissociation of Spt16 from the 3’ ends of transcribed genes. In addition to causing Spt16 dissociation defects, the more severe ISGI mutants confer a variety of growth phenotypes, including slow growth, cold sensitivity, and in some cases lethality. Specific mutations in ISGI caused yeast colonies to develop cold sensitivity and/or sickness, were synthetic lethal, or had no effect. Current studies in the lab aim at identifying proteins with possible roles in promoting Spt16 dissociation from genes. Using a synthetic gene array strategy, previous students in the lab identified ~150 proteins that displayed genetic interaction phenotypes with an ISGI mutant suggestive of a role in facilitating Spt16-gene dissociation. Here, I present our progress in these studies and our future plans. We expect these experiments will lead to the identification of one or more factors that promote Spt16 dissociation from chromatin, which is integral to proper gene expression.",Omnivore,7/5/23 15:12,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,,P32,P32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During elongation, FACT – composed of two proteins, Spt16 and Pob3, in S. cerevisiae – contributes to disassembling nucleosomes in front of Pol II and reassembly following Pol II passage. In previous work, we identified a nucleosomal region – ISGI (Influences Spt16-Gene Interactions) – vital in promoting proper interactions between FACT and transcribed genes. More specifically, mutations within this region cause an accumulation of FACT at the 3’ ends of genes, an effect we attribute to impaired FACT dissociation from genes following transcription. 

Two recent studies have unveiled an association between mutations within one of two genes that encode the human histone H3.3 protein and neurodevelopmental disorders in patients. One of these mutants, H3.3-L61R, corresponds to a strong ISGI mutant, providing a possible link between the neurodevelopmental disorders and FACT-gene disassociation defects. To further explore this potential link and to gain a more general understanding of the effects of human H3.3 mutants on chromatin biology, we are generating yeast cells that carry several of the H3.3 mutations found in the patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. We will then analyze them for defects in FACT-gene interactions and other processes, including cryptic internal transcription initiation, DNA replication, and DNA repair.

Overexpression of apoptotic DNases, in particular DNase I and EndoG, in cells and tissues was shown to induce DNA fragmentation. This DNA destruction makes cell death irreversible, while genetic knockout or chemical inhibitors of apoptotic DNases usually prevent cell death. The search for new DNase inhibitors as anti-cell death drugs requires simple quantitative methods for their testing. The goal of the current study was to evaluate isolated cell nuclei as a potential model for testing apoptotic DNase inhibitors and to determine whether DNase I or EndoG directly cause the 200bp ladder. Cell nuclei were isolated by Triton X-100 method from kidneys (expressing DNase I) and brains (with DNase I inactivated by alternative splicing) of wild-type (WT), DNase I knockout (KO), or EndoG KO mice and subjected to autodigestion for varying periods of time from 0 to 240 min in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, which universally activate DNases. Four previously developed inhibitors were tested, including DNase I inhibitors, IG17 and ZnNAC, and EndoG inhibitors, PNR-3-80 and PNR-3-82. DNA was then purified and subjected to 1.4% agarose gel electrophoresis. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide, photographed, and quantified by densitometry using the ImageJ program. EndoG KO or inhibitors did not affect the 200bp-ladder DNA fragmentation, indicating that EndoG is not directly involved in it. DNase I KO slightly mitigated DNA fragmentation by only 5-10% compared to WT, but strongly inhibited DNA fragmentation in the brain. Importantly, DNase I inhibitors strongly inhibited DNA fragmentation (likely due to effects on several DNases). In conclusion, the isolated nuclei model is applicable for testing apoptotic DNase inhibitors.

Towards this the intestinal barrier effects and its role in the gut-liver axis is an emerging area of research in the Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The NAFLD is also associated with the life-style factors such as a high fat, high sugar diets. In an earlier study* 25 strains of Cross Collaborative mice (a population of mice designed to approximate the genetic variability of the human population; hereon called CC mice), showed strain and sex-specific differences in the development of liver pathologies when fed high fat, high sucrose diet (HF/HS) for 16 weeks.

The fold change in the gene expression in the HF/HS diet as compared to control, for each of the time point groups were then computed using the gene globe analysis tool to determine changes in gene expression. The data has suggested that a high fat, high sucrose diet affects the expression of genes responsible for gut permeability.

We observed an increase in significantly different analyte levels after HF/HS diet in blood serum at 40 weeks (63%) for both male and female mice, compared to 20 weeks (27%) and 60 weeks (10%). Analysis of inflammation analytes in liver tissue revealed significantly different quantities after HF/HS diet in 31 of the 36 analytes. Similar to blood serum, we observed that the majority of analytes exhibited changes after 40 weeks (44%) of HF/HS diet in male and female mice, compared to 20 weeks (25%) and 60 weeks (31%). These results are in agreement with liver pathology, which indicated an increase in inflammation in mice fed an HF/HS diet for 40 weeks.

In 1999, the World Health Organization estimated that one-third of the population had latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. This has since been updated to one-fourth of the world. The danger of TB is amplified by mutations which can result in antibiotic resistance. Long term use or misuse of an antibiotic acts as a selection force for bacteria that are drug resistant, which necessitates the development of new drugs. Rifamycin, particularly rifampicin, has been a mainstay of TB treatment since the 1960’s; it binds the 𝛃 subunit of the MBT RNA polymerase (RNAP) and blocks RNA synthesis. Amid the antibiotic resistance crisis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)–the pathogen causing TB– has shown widespread resistance to rifampicin, making it futile in TB therapy as MTB RNAP mutations disrupt key interactions between the drug and the target. By utilizing the ‘enabling reaction’ of the rifamycin core and coupling it with click chemistry, we have exploited the thoroughly studied rifamycin scaffold to target MDR-TB and potentially treat other bacterial infections. Our work highlights the first report of synthesis, isolation, and purification of rifamycin derivatives with azido, alkyne and triazole functionalities, the innovative products of coupling complex rifamycin chemistry and simple click chemistry.",Omnivore,7/5/23 8:59,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,T3,,,P38,"T3,P38",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C. Gunderson,Hendrix College,,William A. Gunderson,Hendrix College,,"Fluorescence-based assays are powerful experimental tools for studying molecular mechanisms of protein action in biomedical research. Many fluorescence-based methods require fluorescent dyes to be attached to proteins in a stoichiometrically defined, site specific, and stable manner. Covalent attachment of fluorophores to proteins is site specific and stable, but to achieve single-site specificity, protein mutations or peptide ligations are often required. To date, there has not been widespread use of non-covalent labeling strategies. Because many proteins are purified using a histidine tag, non-covalent labeling strategies that target histidine tags could find widespread use. We have identified an RNA aptamer from the literature that has picomolar affinity for histidine tagged proteins. We hypothesize that this RNA aptamer can be used for labeling histidine tagged proteins with a fluorophore. Here, we characterize the interaction between the RNA aptamer and histidine tagged proteins and demonstrate the utility of this fluorophore labeling scheme with proof-of-principle fluorescence experiments.  The universality of the histidine tag as a purification method makes this labeling strategy particularly appealing. In addition, the aptamers can be readily obtained commercially conjugated to a large selection of labels.",Omnivore,7/3/23 0:51,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,P39,,P39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Copper has been shown to disrupt crucial cellular functions such as amino acid synthesis and DNA replication via displacement of Fe from Fe-S clusters. Alternatively, the reaction of copper with hydrogen peroxide in phagocytic cells leads to the generation of reactive radicals and ions, which exhibit potent antimicrobial properties due to damage they cause to proteins and nucleic acids within the cell. Therefore, pathogens have evolved intricate mechanisms to overcome copper toxicity through sequestration and extrusion of excess intracellular copper.

Understanding the mechanism underlying copper resistance in Salmonella strains provides valuable insights into the development of effective strategies to combat this pathogen and could pave the way for the development of innovative therapeutics.  

Here we show that one isolate of Salmonella enterica serovar enterica isolated from retail meat carries copper-resistant genes, which conferred resistance to 1mM CuCl2 and enhanced survival in macrophages.",Herbivore (Vegetarian),7/5/23 15:24,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,,P40,P40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gamma Secretase Inhibitors (GSI) inhibit Notch signaling and were previously thought of as a possible solution to treat MM. However, GSIs cause a variety of toxic side effects such as severe gut toxicity and have failed in clinical trials. Therefore, the Delgado-Calle Lab developed a therapy which inhibits Notch named Bone-Targeted Gamma Secretase Inhibitor (BT-GSI). BT-GSI specifically targets bone, and consequently does not have severe side effects like GSI does. Because this drug is so recent, there is still speculation of its body distribution, as well as how it impacts the bone. Through the use of pharmacokinetics, I plan to study how the drug distributes in the body and if it accumulates in the bone over time. I will also use microCT imaging to study the effect BT-GSI has on the skeleton of mice with MM.

DM has a degenerative effect on bone, and diabetic patients have a higher risk of bone fracture compared to normoglycemic individuals.  Bone mineral density (BMD) is significantly reduced in Type 1 (T1DM) patients, and unaffected or even higher in T2DM patients; however, in both conditions bone formation rate is low, and bone microarchitecture is compromised. Recent experiments using a pre-clinical mouse model demonstrated that two of the FDA approved bone anabolic agents, (ligands of the PTH1R), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and the PTHrP analog abaloparatide (ABL) restored bone lost and increased bone quality in T2DM mice.  However, it is still not clear which cells are responsible for the anabolic effects of PTH and ABL in T2DM mice. The current study utilizes DMP1-8kb-Cre mice to conditionally knock out (cKO) the PTH1R in osteocytes. DEXA analysis shows that in both control and cKO mice, the total BMD was reduced by T2DM, indicating that the removal of PTH1R from the osteocytes does not impact T2DM pathological effects in bone. Ongoing analysis of BMD will determine if the removal of PTH1R from the osteocyte will alter the regenerative effects of PTH and ABL on diabetic bone.",Omnivore,7/3/23 13:11,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,P43,,P43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Model and High-power rocketry can be used to conduct scientific experiments. These experiments often make use of the payload section of the rocket, which can hold relevant technology or specimens. Our research team has used rocketry to conduct biological research. 
During the summers of 2022 and 2023, we made progress in our research with the LADCAP (Launchable Automatic Device for Collecting Airborne Particles). The LADCAP is made up of a vacuum pump which draws air through a hole in the side of the rocket and then through a filter. The filter catches airborne microbes that can later be cultured and identified. The vacuum is instructed by an onboard flight computer to begin collecting samples after a particular amount of time from launch. This system could potentially be used with a wide range of craft, but our air-testing has been conducted with the custom-built mid-power rocket G-Lifter, the scratch-built high-power rocket The Highlander, the Madcow Adventurer, and the LOC Precision Hi-Tech. LADCAP collects high-altitude microorganisms which can withstand extremes including temperature, low pressure, desiccation, and increased UV flux. The particles are thusly considered extremophiles. The data collected about extremophiles on earth can potentially be extrapolated to extremophiles in other locations, including those elsewhere in the solar system. Biological research with the LADCAP system and rocketry is contained within the designation of “aeromicrobiology.”

G4 structures can present an endogenous barrier to replication fork progression. Failure to bypass G4s during DNA replication results in an increase in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which can lead to genomic instability. Rev1 is a translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerase that disrupts and replicates G4 DNA, though the precise mechanism is unclear. We seek to elucidate the relationship between human Rev1 (hRev1) and replication gap suppression near G4 sites. To test the effects of hRev1 loss on G4-associated ssDNA formation, we will perform non-denaturing immunofluorescence detection of two thymidine analogs, 5-chloro-2’-deoxyuridine (CldU) and 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU), in WT and REV1KO cells. We aim to further explore the relationship between replication stress near G4 sites and hRev1 using proximity ligation assay experiments, in which we will investigate whether the presence of hRev1 affects the formation of G4 structures near (i) ssDNA and (ii) components of the replisome.

Many children are eating high-calorie, low-nutrient foods, and have low levels of  physical activity. These children are more likely to carry over their obesity into adulthood—becoming more prone to clinical risks for cardiometabolic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. It is unclear if there are differences between physiological responses to exercises when comparing children with obesity and normal-weight. This current study aims to assess whether there is a correlation between heart rate and oxygen (O2) uptake in children 8-11 years old during rest and submaximal exercise. Methods: The data being used is from a study where heart rate was measured using a metabolic cart during rest and during 30 min biking at either 30 Watts or at a workload corresponding to 40% of their peak O2 uptake. Using Pearson Correlation Factor  data is being analyzed to find out whether there is a positive, negative, or no correlation. Between O2 uptake and heart rate at rest and at submaximal exercise. Data is divided into two separate categories of girls and boys with normal weight or obesity. Results: As of now, comparisons are still being made to conclude this study. Conclusion: With these data we will learn about how normal weight and obesity respond to exersice.

This is in part due to the desmoplastic and poorly perfused stroma of PDAC characterized by overexpression of hyaluronic acid (HA) and collagen (CN), which significantly impair drug delivery and infiltration of immune cells into tumor tissues. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a widely used vesiculovirus, has shown tremendous clinical potential as an oncolytic agent in several in vivo models of pancreatic cancer. VxG, a novel hybrid VSV-derived oncolytic vector lacks the neurotoxicity associated with VSV treatment and retains the fast kinetics and potent cytotoxic effects of VSV. The goal of this study was to provide in vitro characterization of the oncolytic activity of VxG-based vectors expressing tumor-degrading enzymes. Vectors engineered to express mouse PH20, collagenase, both mouse PH20 and collagenase, as well as serraptidase were analyzed. Through TCID50 assays, the engineered VxG-based vectors were shown to have comparable infectivity to the parent virus. Further, cell viability assays and crystal violet performed on a susceptible, moderate, and resistant mouse pancreatic cell line demonstrated clear oncolytic activity among all viruses. These findings suggest that the enzyme expressing VxG vectors produce viable infection in PDAC cell lines and are promising candidates for in vivo testing. Ongoing studies will utilize mouse models to determine whether targeting HA and CN in tumor stroma maximizes the oncolytic activity of VxG and increases immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment.",Omnivore,7/5/23 23:49,,Black or African American,,,,,,,,,,,,Multiracial,Female,Female,,,,,,,,T4,P49,,"T4,P49",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aim to use X-ray crystallography to determine the molecular basis for the selectivity of a newly discovered inhibitor for MNK1 and MNK2. We began by transforming bacteria with a DNA plasmid coding for an MNK attached to a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag. Cells were lysed and centrifuged leaving the water-soluble MNK in the supernatant, which was mixed with glutathione beads that bound to the GST-tagged MNK. Afterwards, the MNK was purified by washing the bead-protein complex, cleaving the GST tag, and filtering the MNK. We further purified the sample via anion-exchange chromatography, separating solutes by charge using an anion gradient. Once the protein was isolated, we prepared an array of solutions to find one that will allow the MNK molecules to crystallize. This will enable us to fire X-rays onto the MNK crystals and utilize the diffraction pattern to calculate the 3D structure. Finding the structural basis for this inhibitor’s binding to MNK1 will allow us to design better drugs for MNKs to suppress their oncogenic effects.",Omnivore,7/4/23 9:42,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,,P48,P48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We surveyed 10 tattoo and PMU inks (five tattoo inks and five PMU inks) from different manufacturers. The inks were tested for bacterial and fungal contamination using the aerobic plating and enrichment methodologies outlined in FDA’s Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) Chapter 23 “Methods for Cosmetics.” Briefly, inks were first diluted in Modified Letheen Broth (MLB) and then plated on Modified Letheen Agar (MLA) and Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) plates to test for bacterial and fungal contamination, respectively. In parallel, diluted ink samples were first enriched in MLB for seven days and then plated on MLA to ensure any microbial contamination within the ink sample would be identified. Plates were incubated at 30℃ for 2-7 days and examined for microbial contamination. Isolated bacteria were lysed, and the cell lysate was used for PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. The species of the bacteria was identified by the 16S rRNA gene sequence.

Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models can be used to predict Ames mutagenicity and are used in place of actual toxicological studies. The goal of this study is to build a reliable model that is able to accurately predict Ames mutagenicity and specifically determine how increasing the sample size of the training dataset impacts how well the model performs on the test dataset. We first conducted data cleaning and removed the chemicals that the model cannot handle from the training datasets and used the cleaned datasets to obtain molecular descriptors that describe molecular structure in numeric form. The next step was feature preprocessing where molecular descriptors with low variance and high correlation was removed from the training data to improve model performance. Then, parameter optimization was conducted on 5 different algorithms (logistic regression, KNN, SVM, random forest, and XGBoost) to determine which parameters resulted in the best model performance for each algorithm. The algorithms and optimized parameters were then used to build a model and assess how the performance changed when providing more of the training data as input. So far, the results show that XGBoost has the best model performance when given one part of the training data as input due to the high F1 score, MCC, specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy and we are working towards obtaining the model performance results when including the rest of the training data as input.  Building accurate QSAR models to predict Ames mutagenicity is important and can save money and increase efficiency when it comes to determining the safety of chemicals.",Herbivore (Vegetarian),7/4/23 20:13,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,,P52,P52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You will collect soil samples or whatever environmental sample you have, then go through the process of shaking a phage off of the sample and isolating and filtering the phages. You will then do spot titers to either confirm or deny that you have found a bacteriophage in your samples. Once you have the results, you will either collect more samples if you do not have a bacteriophage present, or you will continue with the process of making sure that you have only one virus. The next step will be to test the bacterial host range of the bacteriophage to see how well it infects related species of bacteria.

Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) 3D printers, specifically, have provided many scientists and engineers with affordable alternatives to developing and customizing parts for experiments and prototypes. FFF is a type of 3D printing in which thermoplastic filament is extruded through a hot, mechanized nozzle and laid onto a platform in successive layers to eventually produce a desired object from an uploaded Computer Aided Design (CAD) file. Because many scientific applications require specialized parts that are oftentimes expensive to purchase or to maintain, being able to 3D print customized components for scientific instrumentation can potentially save time (commercial manufacturing and shipping) and money, as FFF 3D printing only requires one moderately priced 3D printer. Here, we present a library of 3D printable optomechanical components. These 3D printable components are near identical to as well as fully compatible with commercial optomechanical components; the library includes posts, post holders, bases, lens mounts, kinematic optics mounts, LED holders, and a breadboard holder. These components were tested for optical functionality and stability in entirely 3D printable optical systems, and we further demonstrate the systems’ comparability in performance to their commercial counterparts.

Polymers can be spun into a construct that has a random configuration of fibers which closely resembles the architecture of the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, changing the polymer composition of the mat allows nanofiber to  facilitate  wound healing . Some of the polymers used also have a natural degradation rate that eradicates the need for dressing removal – particularly with respect to internal dressings. In this experiment, the natural polymer alginate was modified to create an ideal compound for wound dressings. Amines similar to amino acids in collagen were attached to the alginate to make it biomimetic and to yield free amines which are known to have antibacterial properties. This modified  alginate (bAlg) was  then oxidized to increase its rate of degradation in physiological conditions. Modified alginate was analyzed via IR spectroscopy to verify the successful attachment of amines. Percent oxidation was determined through the use of an indicator. After modification, the biomimetic, oxidized alginate (oxbAlg) was electrospun with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and the fiber mats were analyzed  in vitro . In vitro cell studies were run over a period of weeks and the effect of the modified alginate on the cells was observed.

The devastating consequences of the opioid crisis are not only the increased number of deaths caused by opioids but also the increased economic burden of combating this crisis. The highly addictive nature of the opioids is closely related to the overdose fatalities caused by prescription opioids, heroin, and illicit fentanyl. However, the therapeutic benefits of prescription opioids acting as the most potent analgesic make prohibition of the drug impossible. Opioids exert its analgesic effect by binding to the µ opioid receptor (MOR), which then activates its downstream signaling pathway, eventually leading to the inhibition of spinal cord pain transmission. Since the discovery of MOR in the 1970s, many efforts have been endeavored to understand the structure activity relationship between the receptor and its ligands, hoping to shed some lights on the development of non- or less-addictive opioid analgesics. Yet, many questions remain unanswered, and the development of non- or less-addictive opioid analgesics has had limited success. Here, we present a machine learning model that can be used to predict the binding activity of small molecule compounds to the MOR based on chemical structures. The random forest models were evaluated using 5-fold cross validations and were challenged with the testing data set, resulting in good MOR binding activity prediction accuracy in the cross validations and testing, respectively. Our results suggest that this model could be useful to identify novel MOR binders, which may aid the development of new drugs targeting on MOR.",Omnivore,7/5/23 16:08,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,,P56,P56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Miller,University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,,Caleb Lovell,University of Arkansas - Fayetteville,,,,,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are used in the treatment of many  types of cancer targeting cancer-specific pathways to minimize damage to healthy cells. Pexidartinib is a type of TKI that has been commonly used to treat rare types of cancers like tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT). While effective in the clinic, p exidartinib has been shown to cause severe liver toxicity through an unknown mechanism. It is hypothesized  that pexidartinib undergoes bioactivation into a quinone. This reactive metabolite could then trigger direct hepatotoxicity and/or harmful immune response. This hypothesis is being tested with metabolic reactions for pexidartinib with lapatinib as a positive TKI control since the drug has published results to undergo bioactivation in the same conditions. Both TKIs will be metabolized using human liver microsomes (HLM) and the reactive quinones trapped with glutathione and the resulting adducts analyzed by LC-MS. Experiments will be carried out with fluorescently labeled dansyl-glutathione, so that the amount of adduct that forms can be quantitated. Currently, preliminary data has been collected to support the possible formation of the expected adduct. Knowing whether pexidartinib undergoes bioactivation or not will justify further research into its metabolic phenotyping and kinetics. If the major enzymes responsible for metabolism can be identified, then assessing risk from patient to patient can be inferred from the known relationship between demographics and variation in those enzymes. Also, if the kinetics and metabolic pathway of the adduct can further be studied, a treatment can be developed to mitigate liver toxicity, allowing patients to receive all the cancer treatment benefits while minimizing damage to the liver by blocking metabolic pathways that form quinones.",Omnivore,7/10/23 16:41,,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,P59,,P59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment options are limited to chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical resection. The lethality of the tumor lies not only in its aggressiveness, but its perseverance. Recurrence of GBM is almost inevitable in most of the GBM patients, usually with the tumor developing therapy resistance. Cancer Stem Cells (CSC), a subset of tumor cells, contribute to tumor relapse by causing tumor initiation. These cells could differentiate into multiple types of cells to maintain a tumor. They are usually treatment-resistant, and often more aggressive. A promising new way to target CSC is to use sesquiterpene lactones (SLs), which are naturally occurring compounds. SLs have anticancer properties by inducing NF-κB gene expression and reacting with thiols in cancer cells. A common thiol, glutathione detoxifies hydroperoxides in cells. Loss of glutathione and the alteration of gene expression causes CSCs to become increasingly sensitive to oxidative stress, leading to a form of cell death named ferroptosis. The aim of the current study is to determine the cytotoxic effects of various SLs in multiple human GBM cell lines (LN18, T98G, U87). We performed MTT viability assays and imaged-based measurements of cell number and confluency utilizing an Incucyte Live Cell imaging. Our first experiments revealed that parthenolide (PTL) and dehyroleucodine (DHL) showed similar IC50 doses (between 5 and 10 uM). Our next step was to plate clonogenic numbers of cells with the control being 400 cells with 1 uM, 5 uM, and 10 uM treatments. We found that the control plates had an average of 96 clones and the 5uM plates with 800 cells had an average of 115.5 supporting our approximate IC50 value between 5 uM and 10 uM.

Key components of the BCR pathway include the transcription factor NF-𝜅B and an NF-𝜅B regulatory protein, CARD11. Activation and nuclear translocation of the NF-𝜅B p65 subunit through phosphorylation promotes the expression of pro-survival oncogenes overexpressed in ABC-DLBCL such as MYC and BCL2. Given the crucial role of CARD11 in facilitating NF-𝜅B activation, we hypothesize that CARD11 repression can decrease NF- 𝜅B p65 phosphorylation, thereby mitigating the expression of anti-apoptotic genes. This lab has previously repressed CARD11 by stabilizing a DNA secondary structure known as a G-quadruplex (G4) in its promoter region. G4s are formed by the folding of guanine-rich DNA into stacked tetrads and are well-known for their ability to alter the transcription of nearby genes. A small molecule that selectively binds and stabilizes the CARD11 G4 was demonstrated to reduce CARD11 transcription in lymphoma cells. To investigate our hypothesis that CARD11 G4-stabilization inhibits NF-𝜅B p65 phosphorylation and the activity of pro-survival genes, two ABC-DLBCL cell lines, RIVA and HBL1, were treated with either a CARD11 G4-stabilizing molecule or a vehicle and subjected to global and phospho-proteomics.  Proteomic analysis is being performed using the QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and Proteoviz softwares to identify differentially expressed proteins and predict pathways altered in the CARD11 - NF-𝜅B signaling axis. We will also determine whether repressing CARD11 directly inhibits NF 𝜅B activation by using immunoblotting to quantify phosphorylated p65 in control cells versus CARD11 G4-stabilized cells. Understanding the role of CARD11 and NF-𝜅B p65 in BCR signaling may uncover more effective molecular targets for the treatment of ABC-lymphomas.",Omnivore,7/3/23 7:52,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,,P62,P62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms of carcinogenesis are relatively unknown, hindering development of effective treatments. Moreover, MM is characterized by cycles of relapse, where remission from treatment is often followed by faster cancer progression and increased drug resistance. Studies have emphasized the importance of bone marrow microenvironment changes in addressing this feature of myeloma relapse and drug response. Specifically, CD14/CD16 monocytes and CD8 T lymphocytes undergo significant proportion changes during MM progression. This study aims to identify potential cell subsets and genetic differences within leukocytes in patients with early MM relapse compared to those without relapse in order to learn about the mechanisms behind disease progression and drug resistance. For this study, bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood cells were collected from patients with early relapse (n=4) and no relapse (n=3) at various treatment timepoints. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed, and Seurat workflow was used for data processing. CD8, CD14, and CD16 cell data were isolated, undergoing normalization, PCA, SCT, and integration, for further clustering analysis. The analysis revealed 9 distinct subclusters within CD14/CD16 monocytes, and 7 within CD8 lymphocytes. Differential expression analysis based on relapse status identified several genes of interest, including FOSB, IL8, IL1B, and HLA genes, which are also consistent with the genes expressed highly in clusters where the proportion of cells increased or decreased substantially. These results build upon previous research that indicates that these genes of interest are involved in the promotion of cancer growth and osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, they suggest that specific subgroups of cells within leukocytes populations play a more significant role in MM relapse, potentially aiding the development of targeted therapies for MM.",Herbivore (Vegetarian),7/4/23 20:51,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Female,,,,,,,I prefer not to say,,,P63,,P63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hamilton,Ouachita Baptist University,,,,,"For centuries, gauze has been central to wound care and healing. As early as the 1980s, hemostatic dressings have helped stabilize wounds in treating traumatic injuries. However, gauze is a foreign substance to the human body and must be removed over time, which is not ideal for all types of wound healing. Some gauze-based hemostatic systems can also cause secondary burn wounds due to excess chitosan, a required substance for its efficacy. In our study, first we designed a novel wound dressing that should improve on current methods. This dressing mimics the human extracellular matrix which helps cell regeneration and will degrade in the body, eliminating the need to change or remove the dressing following application. The amount of chitosan utilized in our dressing is also reduced, lowering the chances of burns within wounds. A carboxylic acid-modified polycaprolactone (PCL) was produced and subsequently modified via amide coupling reactions to produce a biomimetic PCL (bPCL). bPCL was electrospun with chitosan to produce fiber mats ready for testing and analysis as a wound dressing. 
The second part of the project focused on the design and construction of a device that would simulate an “open wound” environment using 3-D printing and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Such a device allows the clotting properties of the dressing to be tested. Specifically, the device would allow the Hamilton lab to perform flow tests to analyze the clotting capabilities of fiber mats. Future studies will analyze the hemostatic properties of the bPCL/chitosan fiber mats by pumping samples of platelets through the device with the fiber mat placed inside.",Omnivore,7/5/23 22:05,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,,P64,P64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elevated levels of circulating cholesterol on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are a primary risk factor for ASCVD, as this promotes LDL accumulation within the sub-endothelial space and subsequent capture by macrophages that patrol the vessel micro-environment. Engorgement of macrophages with LDL results in these cells becoming foam cells; a large, dysfunctional, lipid-loaded cell that often becomes necrotic and directly contributes to plaque growth. Therapies that target foam cell dysfunction to treat or prevent ASCVD are in high demand; however, progress is limited by an incomplete understanding of why LDL uptake promotes macrophage dysfunction and foam cell biogenesis. Recently, our group reported that LDL transports small RNA and these non-traditional cargo trigger inflammatory polarization of macrophages by activating toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8), an endosomal sensor of single stranded RNA. Most intriguingly, antagonism of TLR8 reduced ASCVD in hyperlipidemic mice and blunted the formation of foam cells within developing plaques. Here, we have hypothesized that TLR8 contributes to foam cell biogenesis by disrupting endosome-to-lysosome transport of internalized LDL particles. To test this hypothesis, we have developed fluorescent fusion proteins to track TLR8 containing vesicles. Furthermore, we have generated novel fluorescent viral-like particles to both activate TLR8 and visualize pinocytic uptake and transport. These tools have been paired with acquired expertise in confocal microscopy to quantify the impact of TLR8 activation on delivery of pinocytic cargo to lysosomes. Ongoing studies will explore how TLR8-induced changes in vesicular trafficking contribute to LDL-induced foam cell dysfunction.",Omnivore,7/5/23 23:37,,Black or African American,,,,,,,,Black or African-American alone,,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,T1,,,P66,"T1,P66",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite standardization of care, at Level I and Level II trauma centers, there remains significant variability in patient outcomes across both levels. The NIH-funded Trauma Institutional Priorities and Teams for Outcomes Efficiency (TIPTOE), links organizational structures in Level 1 and Level 2 centers to patient outcomes as reported by Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP). This study aims to provide ontological representation for TQIP data elements to integrate TQIP data with data on organizational structures. To integrate, the study reconstructed definitions and labels from TQIP’s data dictionary, the National Trauma Data Standard (NTDS), using standard terminological practices. NTDS tends to define circularly, meaning words from the term are in the definition. New definitions follow genus-differentia format: Term is a member of a specific superclass and has unique characteristics. Terms and definitions were implemented in a Web Ontology Language (OWL) file using Protégé Ontology Editor. OWL is a language with formal semantics allowing for description and classification of concepts within a domain enabling a computer to make inferences. Protégé is an app for creating and editing OWL ontologies. For categorization, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) was imported into the OWL file. BFO is an established ontology with overarching taxonomies serving as an upper level for several other ontologies. Through this process, new definitions and labels were created for 20 NTDS terms. Terms were relabeled to conform to labeling standards for ontology development. Based on the new definitions, 10 of the 20 terms were implemented into an OWL file with BFO imported. Future work will expand this file so terminology can be consumed by a computer.

In this study, we are characterizing the influences that burn severity, and time post burn have on mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to further understand the pathways of burn induced hypermetabolism.
Studies show that induced hypermetabolism, present in patients with sepsis and other trauma, is associated with high energy dependent reactions that negatively affect patient recovery. Because hypermetabolism has been detected after trauma like sepsis and chemotherapy by higher protein turnover, and cytokine levels; we hypothesized that samples from burned individuals will present a higher respiration than controls. By comparing samples, we hope to gain insight into the metabolic pathways that can be the early stages for improving therapeutics and overall patient outcomes. Blood samples from 125 adult and pediatric patients will be collected for this purpose. With current samples, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) have been isolated by centrifugation, and mitochondria (OXPHOS) has been measured using Oroboros O2K High Resolution Respirometry (HRR) instruments. 
We have used Substrate-uncoupler-inhibitor titration (SUIT) protocol RP1 to test mitochondrial function, and core energy metabolism is analyzed by comparing O2 consumption at each substrate injection. Datlab software and spreadsheets for data collection and analysis are being used.
Current results include 7 burn patient samples and 14 control samples. The ratio of O2 flux concentration over the max respiration after the addition of each substrate has been compared to control values using a Box and Whiskers graph. More samples and analysis are needed to get a true comparison of o2 consumption.",Omnivore,7/5/23 22:18,,,,,,Some Other Race,,Hispanic,,,,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,,P68,P68,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arithrospira platensis, also known as Spirulina, is a protein-rich cyanobacterium that could potentially provide a solution to these issues with minimal energy consumption. Spirulina is known to be used for protein supplementation with various health benefits and pharmacological applications. In addition, Spirulina cultures produce high amounts of oxygen through the conversion of carbon dioxide into energy. Proliferation and oxygen production are primarily dependent on cell structure (straight or coiled). A mixed culture containing straight and coiled Spirulina cells and a primarily coiled Spirulina culture were studied using 2.5 L containers under 40 µM, 60 µM, and 80 µM light intensities in order to determine the behavior of cell reproduction and its effects on oxygen production. Cell reproduction and oxygen production were monitored in 24-hour intervals. Preliminary results indicate that coiled cultures produced higher cell counts (60,000 cells/mL) than mixed cultures (50,000 cells/mL) at 40-60 μmol light intensities. In regards to oxygen produced per cell, mixed cultures produced more oxygen (0.001 oxygen/cell) than coiled cultures (0.0005 oxygen/cell). These results imply that coiled cells utilize more energy in cellular activities while straight cells utilize more energy during photosynthesis. Additional studies need to be done to determine these differences and to discern which cell structure is most effective for long-term space travel.",Omnivore,7/5/23 16:05,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,T10,P69,,"T10,P69",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous work has shown that PEL cells require the expression of the oncogene MCL1, which stops intrinsic apoptosis. Furthermore, related on-going work in our laboratory reveals that MCL1 may synergize with another oncogene MARCHF5. This is surprising since MARCHF5 has not been linked to apoptosis; it is instead known as a mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates clients involved in mitochondrial fusion/fission and antiviral sensing. Our goal is to define the function of MARCHF5 in PEL cell lines. Using a PEL cell line with a doxycycline-inducible Cas9, we showed that CRISPR knockout (KO) of MARCHF5 led to a significant decrease of live cells accompanied by increased caspase 3/7 activity. Western blot analysis reveals that the pro-apoptotic protein NOXA is stabilized upon MARCHF5 KO suggesting that MARCHF5 functions to block intrinsic apoptosis. Cell death due to MARCHF5 KO is independent of lytic reactivation or activation of antiviral sensing. Interestingly, staining with mitochondrial dyes followed by flow cytometry revealed that loss of MARCHF5 decreased both mitochondrial content as well as mitochondrial membrane potential.  In sum, our results indicate that in PEL cells, the oncogene MARCHF5 functions to maintain mitochondrial health as well as regulate cell survival by synergizing with MCL1.

Doxorubicin (DOX) is a chemotherapeutic medicine used for the treatment of many types of cancer; however, the use of DOX in clinical practice has been limited because of side effects, notably cardiotoxicity. However, there is no effective treatment for the DOX-induced cardiomyocyte injury. The peptide Szeto-Schiller (SS)-31 (H-D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH2, elamipretide) targets to mitochondria and reduces the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the diseased cardiomyocytes. Our preliminary data showed that SS-31 attenuates 50nM DOX induced cardiomyoblast H9C2 cell senescence. To be more translationally, in this study, we further evaluated whether SS-31 ameliorates the DOX induced human induced pluripotent stem cell differentiated cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) senescence. We differentiated the hiPSCs to cardiomyocytes by RBA protocol and the cells started beating at ~ day 8. Then the hiPSC-CMs were treated with 50 µM DOX for 3 hours and cultured for 48-72 hours. The SS-31 were added with DOX treatment and after removal of the DOX. We tested the senescence markers p16, p21 and MMP3. We found that p21 was increased after DOX treatment for 18 hours and was partially reduced by 1µM SS-31. The expression of p16 and MMP3 was upregulated after 50nM DOX treatment for 18 hours (p16) and 48 hours (MMP3), whereas SS-31 failed to reduce the elevation of p16 and MMP3. This data suggested that SS-31 protects the DOX induced senescence in the hiPSC-CMs. We will further test senescence associated secretory phenotype markers TNFa, IL-6, and IL-1β.",Herbivore (Vegetarian),7/5/23 10:21,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,,P72,P72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Excessive deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are two salient features of AD. The accumulation of metals in Amyloid Plaques has been suggested to play an important role in the development of Alzheimer’s Pathology. To establish a causative relationship, this study examines the buildup of the protein Ferritin within the Microglia of the brain. Ferritin is an important protein that maintains iron homeostasis by oxidizing the metal into less reactive species. Ferritin has two isoforms, one that is H-rich, and one that is L-rich. Central Nervous system microglia contain L-rich ferritin. 

Purpose


To determine a causative relationship between buildup of iron within Amyloid plaques, and the progression of AD Pathology. 


Methods

Rat brain sections were cut 25 microns thin, and stained with Congo red.  Ferritin was visualized by using light-microscopic histochemistry, and Congo red was used to determine whether deposition of ferritin was related to the buildup of Amyloid plaques. 

Results

In Transgenic rat, ferritin levels increased with time in both the Cortex and anterior hippocampus. In non-transgenic mice, there was no discernable correlation over time. In both male and female 6 months old rat, Ferritin was ubiquitously present in the brain. Most of the cortical and hippocampal ferritin are of microglial type with intense cell body with processes, however, the thalamus, striatum, and amygdala show circular ferritin cells with no apparent processes. In the transgenic AD rat, ferritin in the cortex was seen proliferated around the plaques and hippocampus in both sexes compared to their non-TG counterparts. 

Conclusion

Two way ANOVA tests indicate strong statistical significance for increase in ferritin levels. It is possible to conclude that iron buildup is causative on the progression of AD pathology.",Omnivore,7/5/23 16:35,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,T6,P75,,"T6,P75",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs) are membrane-bound enzymes that dephosphorylate a broad range of bioactive lipids including lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Of the three mammalian LPPs, global deletion of the PLPP3 gene encoding LPP3 in mice leads to early embryonic lethality due to defects in blood vessel formation. Adult mice with deletion of PLPP3 in endothelial cells (conditional KO) have increased vascular permeability. PLPP3 variants that result in lower LPP3 protein levels are associated with increased risk of CAD in humans. We therefore hypothesized that LPP3 plays a critical role in endothelial cell (EC) differentiation and function. To investigate this possibility, we used gene editing approaches to disrupt the PLPP3 gene in human induced pluripotent stem cells.  LPP3 protein and mRNA were undetectable in these cells. Wildtype (WT) and PLPP3 null iPSCs were differentiated into mature endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) using specialized media. OCT4 gene expression, a pluripotent stem cell marker, remained unchanged between the genotypes, validating pluripotency. However, there were marked differences in morphology and growth patterns. WT cells assumed a cobblestone morphology and grew uniformly typical of endothelial cells in vitro, while KO cells grew as clusters in a haphazard manner. PECAM1, a hallmark of endothelial cells responsible for junction integrity, was significantly reduced in the LPP3 KO iPSC-ECs. These findings suggest a reduced differentiation and developmental potential in cells lacking LPP3. Ongoing studies will likely provide evidence of disruption of barrier function in tube-formation assays.

Upon administration, the drug acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase, thereby impeding the process of leukotriene synthesis which is involved in asthma pathogenesis. Because of the beneficial effect, this drug is frequently prescribed for the treatment of chronic asthma and other inflammatory diseases. However, the long-term administration of zileuton therapy exhibited a correlation with elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT; originally referred to as serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)), thereby suggesting hepatotoxicity. To mitigate the challenges associated with solubility and bioavailability, our lab has developed a nanocrystal formulation that has demonstrated beneficial outcomes. The primary objective of this study is to examine the effects of the zileuton nanocrystal formulation on the levels of the ALT enzyme in the plasma and ileal tissue and compared to other conventional formulations (physical mixture, pure drug and other excipients used in formulation) as well as positive control. 
	In this study, the rats were subjected to various forms of zileuton treatment for 15 days including active pharmaceutical ingredient, zileuton nanocrystal formulated drug, and physical mixture. In addition to these zileuton-treated groups, other groups were treated with an empty capsule (placebo) or served as control animals that received no treatment. Plasma samples were obtained at three time points: 1 hour, day 8, and day 15. Ileal tissue samples were only collected on day 15. The findings demonstrated a significant statistical difference (p < 0.05) between several of the treatment groups, as observed in both the ileum tissue and the plasma. Additionally, intriguing findings have been observed in the comparison between genders, as well as between the time points of day 8 and day 15.

To induce mitochondrial poration, the pore-forming protein BAK is activated from a dormant state by the BH3-only BCL-2 family proteins including BID, BIM, and PUMA through protein-protein interactions. How PUMA activates BAK remains unresolved, and we sought to investigate this mechanism. A crystal structure of the BH3 domain of PUMA bound to BAK has revealed that binding of the BH3 at the hydrophobic groove of BAK destabilizes the inhibitory helix α1 of BAK, as observed in other BH3 complexes with BAK. Moreover, the AlphaFold structure of the complex of full-length BAK and PUMA has indicated a C-terminal tail following the BH3 domain, which forms a short α-helix possibly implicated in atypical membrane tethering. We tested these structure-based hypotheses in binding and
functional assays using peptide-based PUMA BH3 mutants, truncated PUMA constructs, and a BAK mutant refractory to direct activation by BH3 ligands. To confirm BH3-in-groove binding, in fluorescence polarization groove-binding assays, the wildtype (WT) PUMA BH3 peptide bound
to BAK with similar affinity as the prototypical direct activator WT BID BH3 peptide, both being similarly able to trigger BAK-mediate liposome permeabilization. Compared to the WT PUMA BH3, rationally designed missense PUMA BH3 mutations that exhibited higher or lower affinity
for BAK promoted diminished and enhanced BAK-mediated liposome permeabilization, but none of them triggered the activation-deficient BAK mutant. The contributions of the disordered regions outside of the BH3 are also being investigated mechanistically considering the AlphaFold structure of the complex. Our results support the hit-and-run weak affinity nature of the PUMA BH3–BAK interaction underlying efficient direct BAK activation and membrane poration.",Omnivore,7/2/23 13:17,White,,,,,,,Hispanic,,,,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,P79,,P79,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Asthma is a chronic, incurable case that affects millions of Americans. With no cure, people used medication to help to reduce asthma symptoms. However, controller medications are being underused, while reliever medications are overused; Recent studies also have found that asthma education and courses reduce the risk of asthma-related death (Zhang et al., 2021). The current study aims to assess whether patients with asthma who take asthma training courses have lower ED rates than patients who do not. This study used data from the 2019 and 2020 Asthma Call Back Survey (ACBS) of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to determine if there is a correlation between taking an asthma course and ED visits and hospitalizations. Outcomes included an ER visit, doctor visit, asthma plan, or asthma course. Statistics included chi-square tests and a logistic regression adjusting for insurance, race, gender, smoking status, if the individual had an asthma plan, city or rural residence, and age. There were 22,934 people unweighted and 39,641,425 weighted from 2019 and 2020. We found that 29.42% had an asthma plan, 12.25% had a hospitalization visit, and 40.07 had an ED visit. People were more likely to go to the ER if they had insurance (1.13), were Native American (2.34), Hispanic (1.18), or Black (1.27), and had at least smoked at some point. If the patient had taken an asthma course, they would likely have an asthma plan (5.71). We found that patients who took an asthma class, had an asthma plan, or had both reported higher ER visits. Patients who smoked were more likely to end up in the ER, and those living in rural areas had fewer ER and ED visits.",Gluten Free,7/4/23 21:44,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,,P80,P80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recognizing the prolonged duration of the clonogenic assay, our research group aims to explore alternative methods that can provide similar results within a shorter time frame.
To address this, we hypothesized that utilizing the incucyte method would yield comparable results to the conventional clonogenic assay, while significantly reducing the time required. Three pancreatic cancer cell lines, namely Pan-1, MP2, and Bxpc-3, were employed in our study. These cell lines were subjected to diverse conditions, dilutions, and treatments in both 96-well and 6-well format.

These creatures possess the ability to survive desiccation not by preventing DNA damage, like in many eukaryotes, but instead by repairing DNA damage caused by desiccation. However, the mechanism for this repair is unknown. Identifying candidate genes and proteins that regulate DNA repair is vital to understanding this process. Furthermore, previous work has identified an atypical DNA ligase homolog (bdLIG) in Adineta vaga that is upregulated following DNA damage. The objective of this project was to use CRISPR genome editing to inactivate the bdLIG gene in the bdelloid Adineta vaga to investigate its role in DNA repair. To achieve this, two sgRNAs were designed to excise the bdLIG and GAPDH (as a control) from the genome. In vitro Cas9 cleavage assays were used to determine the efficiency of the sgRNAs. DNA templates were designed to replace the target genes during homology-directed repair. For CRISPR in A. vaga, different electroporation conditions using GFP- tagged Cas9 were explored. Then, CRISPR was carried out by electroporating embryos with the sgRNA/ Cas9 complexes and GFP repair template. For evidence of genome editing, rotifers were examined under a fluorescence microscope for GFP expression. Once a mutant rotifer with the inactivated bdLIG gene is identified, individuals will be desiccated and subsequently rehydrated to induce DNA repair. The recovery rate for desiccated wild-type rotifers at varying time stamps was determined in this project. Thus, a reduced rate of recovery in mutant rotifers compared to the wild-type would insinuate the bdLIG gene plays a crucial role in DNA repair.",Omnivore,7/5/23 16:03,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,P83,,P83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, the alphacoronavirus NL-63 is proposed to be a safe surrogate for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is the etiological agent of COVID-19. A surrogate virus has the same molecular mechanism as a more deadly virus, but produces self-limiting infections. While the pandemic is over, finding suitable surrogates to study viruses safely is essential to help head off future outbreaks. Also, finding ways to increase research in BSL-2 environments using surrogates serves to enhance research speed and efficiency in the future. However, little is known about ways to quickly quantify NL-63. The current gold-standard is immunofluorescence; however, this takes time and requires expensive reagents and equipment to read results. We propose a qPCR assay that is specific and sensitive for the nucleocapsid of NL-63. First, we designed the qPCR primers to the conserved ORF1 region of the NL-63 virus and validated them for specificity. The amplification efficiency of the qPCR assay was determined and consistently performed at 90-110%, with melt curves indicating a lack of non-specific amplifications and dimer formation. Additionally, using cDNA from an experimentally infected animal with NL-63 that was previously quantified, we ran a full doubling dilution curve and ran the amplicons on a 2% agarose gel. Data indicates that using native NL-63, semi-quantitatively, we have excellent amplification through the full range of dilution. The repeatability of the stability of the curve and lack of untargeted amplification indicates that the primers are likely suitable for downstream analyses. Additionally, the qPCR protocol only required four hours compared to two days using immunofluorescence. Further analyses will include evaluating the primers for sensitivity and specificity using quantified RNA standards and evaluating how closely the NL-63 qPCR assay compares to immunofluorescent technique.",Omnivore,7/5/23 15:45,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,,P84,P84,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cardiac disease is the leading cause of death in the aged (˃65 years-old) population. However, the mechanism of cardiac aging remains elusive. Mitochondrial proton leak is increased in the aged cardiomyocyte. We hypothesize that the augmented proton leak contributes to cardiac senescence. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated whether the proton ionophore, dinitrophenol (DNP) which carries the proton from inter membrane space to the matrix to mimic the excessive proton leak in the cardio myoblast H9C2 cell line. We found that DNP concentration dependently decreased the cell growth rate. Also, ?? µM DNP induced H9C2 cell senescence with ?? days. These data suggest that the excessive proton leak is a cause of cardiomyocyte senescence. We will further evaluate the DNP induced H9C2 cell senescence with other acceptable markers, such as p16, p21, TNFα, IL-6 and IL1β.",Omnivore,7/5/23 10:18,White,,,,,,,Hispanic,,,,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,P85,,P85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BPA is a fluorescent compound with excitation and emission wavelengths of 278 nm and 304 nm, respectively. Due to the small amount of BPA leaching from feminine hygiene products and the resulting complex sample matrix, the standard addition method was used to calculate the BPA concentrations obtained from these samples. To further analyze the leaching effects, a simulated vaginal fluid was utilized as the solvent to mimic the pH and proteins of the female vagina. The leaching of BPA from menstrual pads was analyzed over a six-hour time period in both the 1:1 methanol/water and simulated vaginal fluid; the fluorescence emission intensity of each sample was determined using the FS-5 spectrofluorometer from Edinburgh Instruments.

The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which race influenced hospitalization outcomes(i.e., hospitalization, days  between readmission, readmission rates, and length of stay) of multi-morbidity patients with a triad of diabetes, depression, and obesity. Deidentified electronic medical record data from the Arkansas Clinical Data Warehouse were collected on 4,156 patients, representing 189,212 hospital encounters between January 1, 2014 and September 9, 2021. Binomial logistic regression assessed associations between specific hospital outcomes and race, and the Mann Whitney-U assessed racial differences in hospital outcomes.  Native Americans had a statistically significantly higher median difference in hospitalizations rates than the rest of the races(i.e., 21.5)(i.e.,African Americans, Caucasian Americans, Asian Americans, and American Indians).Furthermore, we can also conclude that each race had a statistically similar median  length of stay.  Over the 7-year study period, we found African Americans had a significantly higher median difference in total number of readmission days (i.e., 2475). We see this similar statistic translate over to median differences in total readmissions over the 7-year study period. African Americans also have a statistically higher median difference in total number of readmissions(i.e., 86). Asian Americans and Native Americans had a statistically higher median difference in average time between readmissions (i.e., 37).

Many lung cancers metastasize, often contributing to poor prognosis. Rnd3, a RhoGTPase and regulator of many cellular processes that are often dysregulated in cancer, has been observed to have an effect on several cancers through varying expression levels. We observed significantly higher survival rates of lung adenocarcinoma patients with lower expression of Rnd3 following analysis of TCGA survival data. Generation of global protein expression profiles of Rnd3 expressing and Rnd3 knockdown A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells using proteomic analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of resulting data predicted that low Rnd3 expression would decrease cell invasion and migration, two properties frequently related to metastasis. Validation of these predictions revealed Rnd3 knockdown significantly decreased cell migration and invasion but also that Rnd3 regulation of cell invasion and migration was independent of ROCK1 signaling, indicating a novel pathway. In this study, we knocked down two known interactors of Rnd3 and regulators of cell migration, p190RhoGAP and RhoA, to further investigate the ROCK1-independent regulatory mechanism that Rnd3 utilizes to regulate cell migration. Wound healing assays were used to measure cell migration of A549 cells following knockdown of p190RhoGAP and RhoA individually and with Rnd3 knockdown.

Hubbard, Ph.D.",Ouachita Baptist University,,,,,"Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a carcinogenic compound found in many plastic-containing products due to its ability to add rigidity and strength to the plastic. However, BPA has been found in a wide variety of products not traditionally thought of as “plastic,” including feminine hygiene products, printer receipts, and even clothing containing a polyester/spandex blend. BPA in clothing indicates possible dermal exposure to BPA—which is traditionally excluded from human BPA exposure analysis—as well as environmental exposure through clothing discarded in landfills.
	BPA is a fluorescent compound, with an excitation wavelength of 278 nm and an emission wavelength of 304 nm. Using fluorescence spectrophotometry, the presence of BPA in polyester/spandex blended clothing was determined by monitoring the leaching of BPA from the fabric over time. Strips of clothing containing polyester/spandex blends were submerged in a 1:1 methanol/water solution for varying amounts of time, ranging from 0 minutes to 6 hours, allowing BPA to seep out of the material. Using the standard addition method to control for other compounds that could also possibly be leaching out of the material, the sample solution (5 mL) and varying amounts of stock solution (0 mL, 2 mL, 5 mL, 7 mL, 10 mL) were added to 25- mL volumetric flasks for each time point and diluted to the line with 1:1 methanol/water solution. The concentration of BPA that leached from the material was then determined by using the Edinburgh Instruments FS-5 to measure the fluorescence emission intensity. Statistical analysis was performed on the results, including linear range, limit of detection, and limit of quantitation.",Omnivore,7/5/23 16:23,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,P91,,P91,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One such stressor is a G-quadruplex (G4), a non-canonical DNA structure frequently encountered in G-rich regions of the genome. G4 structures require specialized proteins for binding and resolution. Rev1, a Y-family polymerase, is heavily involved in this activity, and allows replication to continue unhindered at sites of G4 sequences. We have previously shown using a supF mutagenesis assay with a G4 containing sequence placed in the lagging strand of a pSP189 plasmid that in HAP-1 cells deficient in Rev1, there is a >200-fold greater mutation frequency compared to Rev1-proficient cells (Ketkar et al., 2021). We will now investigate the positional effect on mutation frequency when G4 is placed in the leading strand of the pSP189 plasmid and compare results. Our previous work, using site-directed mutagenesis has shown the important role played by residues E466 and Y470 of human Rev1 in binding and resolving G4 DNA. We will conduct similar mutagenic studies to produce catalytically inactive Rev1 (D570A/E571A) either by itself, or in combination with the insert-2 mutations, to investigate whether catalytic activity of Rev1 is essential for binding and replication of G4. Questions surrounding the mechanism by which Rev1 works, particularly with respect to its recruitment of other proteins to resolve G4 sequences, remain. The C-terminal domain of Rev1 is believed to play a crucial role in protein interactions. Towards this end, a cell line that stably expresses Rev1 with C-terminal deletion (1-1040) will be generated. This cell line will be used in techniques like isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND), as well as immunofluorescence microscopy approaches like proximity-ligation assays to investigate the role of various Rev1 motifs in protein recruitment at G4 sites.",Omnivore,6/30/23 16:30,White,,,,,,,Hispanic,,,,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,,P92,P92,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA helicase, HELB, plays a pivotal role in facilitating cellular recovery from this stress. While HELB's role in DNA repair is established, its involvement in DNA replication and the precise mechanisms underlying its function and interactions with other proteins remain uncertain and warrant further investigation. ATR is the master kinase regulating the replication stress response, which suggested a potential link between HELB phosphorylation by ATR and its recruitment to sites of single-stranded DNA exposure, where it interacts with replication protein A (RPA). The primary objective of this study was to examine the influence of ATR on HELB recruitment during DNA replication stress. Wild-type cells were treated with hydroxyurea (HU) and HU in conjunction with the ATR inhibitor AZD6738 to induce replication stress and prevent activation of the replication stress response respectively. To establish a control for ATR function, this experiment monitored the phosphorylation status of Chk1, a downstream target of ATR. By evaluating the presence of HELB in the soluble fraction, chromatin fraction, and whole-cell extract under varying treatment conditions, the primary aim was to elucidate HELB recruitment patterns and investigate the interplay between ATR and HELB during the DNA replication stress response. Additionally, GAPDH and histone H4 were employed as controls for the soluble and chromatin fractions, respectively, ensuring the precision of the fractionation techniques employed. With this method, we found that HELB is recruited to chromatin in response to HU treatment in an ATR-independent manner. The forthcoming phase of this study aims to investigate the necessity of replication fork reversal catalysis by SMARCAL1 and ZRANB3 for HELB recruitment. Additionally, we aim to investigate the requirement of HELB's interaction with RPA and/or ATPase activity in its chromatin localization process.",Omnivore,6/28/23 15:57,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,T11,,,P94,"T11,P94",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A predominance of the evidence indicates that AD is precipitated by accumulation of the amyloid ꞵ-peptide, which elicits an inflammatory response in the brain that includes an elevation in the levels of cytokines such as interleukin-1ꞵ (IL-1ꞵ) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Growing research also suggests a relationship between the dysregulation of brain glucose metabolism and the pathology of AD. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial brain cells, are essential for maintaining homeostasis in the brain, especially the conveyance of glucose from blood vessels to neuronal elements deeper in the brain parenchyma. Astrocytes primarily transport glucose through glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) enzyme. Aꞵ and a combination of IL-1ꞵ and TNF can disrupt GLUT1 regulation, resulting in attenuated glucose transport. Findings in other systems suggest that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) or GRP78/BiP may respond to cytokines and influence GLUT1. In primary cultures of astrocytes, TXNIP was manipulated through a molecular approach (RNAi) and GRP78/BiP pharmacologically (small-molecule inhibitor) to test the impact on glucose uptake in the presence and absence of cytokines. Initial results indicate a role for GRP78/BiP but not TXNIP, findings being tested through ongoing experiments.

Unfortunately, most of the common chemotherapeutics used in the treatment of breast cancer develop cognitive impairments, or chemobrain, which may affect the quality of life in the survivors. Cyclophosphamide Methotrexate 5-fluorouracil (CMF), a toxic combination therapy for breast cancer treatment, has significantly increased survival rates in the patients. Recent studies have shown that chemotherapeutics may induce long term cognitive dysfunctions including memory impairment, anxiety, and depression. However, very few studies have shown the underlying mechanisms involved in chemobrain. Hence, the aim of the current study is to assess the mechanisms of prolonged anxiety and depressive behaviors caused by chemotherapeutics in mice. 12 weeks C57/B6 mice were treated with intraperitoneal (IP) injections weekly for 4 weeks of either saline (0.9% NaCl) or CMF (60, 4, and 60 mg/kg, respectively). Force Swim Test (FST), Elevated Plus (EV), Y-Maze, Novel Object Recognition (NOR), and Tail Suspension tests were performed to study anxiety and despair-like behavioral changes. Tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics will be used to assess neural protein networks in the amygdala along with western blotting to observe neuronal activity and microglial activation.

The most common genetic type is caused by dominant mutations in the genes encoding type I collagen. The leading cause of death among OI patients is respiratory disease and complications, and recent research has revealed that there may be primary lung defects responsible for these complications. The hypothesis is that abnormal type I collagen causes primary changes in lung development and composition as it affects the lung's extracellular matrix, which is crucial to lung development, homeostasis, and injury-repair. This project aims to characterize the lung and respiratory phenotype of mouse models of OI using the CrtapKO mouse and a novel Col1a1Floxed/+; EIIa-Cre mouse. Past Histological studies observed morphological differences between these CrtapKO mice and control wild-type mice including alveolar simplification and increased alveolar space. These studies on Col1a1Floxed/+; EIIa-Cre mice are expected to yield similar results. Additionally, a protocol for complete lung dissociation into single-cell suspension for single-cell RNA sequencing of the lung was optimized. This will enable study of the transcriptome changes in these mice. The protocol for single-cell RNA sequencing will require close coordination of lung dissociation, flow cytometry to sort out cells of interest, and finally, sequencing at the UAMS Genomics Core. Flow cytometry was used to eliminate hematopoietic cells (CD45+) and endothelial cells (CD31+) in order to enrich for the cells of interest: fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing is currently scheduled in the second half of July and is expected to reveal a reduction in transcripts involving cell adhesion and movement which would suggest abnormal formation of secondary septae during the alveolar stage of lung development.",Omnivore,7/5/23 20:08,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,,P98,P98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of imatinib in therapeutic settings has been associated with severe hepatic injury; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of imatinib and explored the molecular mechanisms underlying its hepatotoxicity using biochemical and molecular analyses. We found that imatinib decreased ATP content in human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. Imatinib also caused decreased cell viability, increased LDH release, and increased caspase 3/7 activation, indicating the induction of apoptosis and necrosis by imatinib. Furthermore, we examined changes in markers of the apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways using Western blot analysis. In HepG2 cells, treatment with imatinib resulted in increased levels of apoptosis pathway hallmarks, such as PARP cleavage and γH2A.X, while expression levels of ER stress markers, CHOP and XBP-1s did not change.  Moreover, we investigated the role of cytochrome P450s (CYPs) in the metabolism of imatinib using HepG2 cell lines individually expressing 14 CYPs (1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, 3A5, and 3A7), as established in our previous work. Using mass spectrometry analyses, we determined that CYP2C8 and 3A4 are responsible for the metabolism of imatinib to N-desmethyl imatinib. In our future studies, we will investigate the potential role of CYP2C8 and 3A4 in the cytotoxicity of imatinib by analyzing whether the cytotoxicity of imatinib can be altered in HepG2 cells overexpressing CYP2C8 or 3A4, compared to the control HepG2 cells.",Omnivore,7/5/23 15:51,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,T7,,,,T7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research aims to create an electrocatalyst that will reduce carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, making for a well-suited pre-catalyst for fuel sources such as methanol and ethanol. To do this, we are making the ligand Bim-py (1-(2-pyridinyl)-1H-benzimidazole). Using 2-bromopyridine, potassium carbonate, and an excess of benzimidazole with a solvent, the Bim-py is made through microwave synthesis. By using a microwave, ligand synthesis can take place in 5-10 minutes, with an additional hour of isolating the product, making it a quickly repeatable process. The currently reported methods require using a Schlenk line and refluxing, which takes up to two days rather than the 1.5 hours with the microwave. Using thin-layer chromatography and 1H NMR, the desired product of Bim-py has been confirmed to be made with results as high as a 71% yield. After making the ligand, it is methylated into [Mebim-py]I. This compound will ultimately be the ligand used to create the catalyst Mn(Mebim-py)(CO)3Br to be tested for efficiency at reducing carbon dioxide.",Omnivore,7/3/23 15:17,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,P103,,P103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typical American Diet (high fat high sucrose diet; HF/HS diet) is known to play a significant role in the development of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) , a metabolic disease that shows interindividual variability in severity. However, the cause of this variability is poorly characterized.  In a previous study (conducted at NCTR), wider range of genetic diverse Cross Collaborative mice (large panel of recombinant inbred mice designed to mirror genetic variability of the human population; CC mice), revealed strain (CC042 and CC011) and sex specific differences in the development of liver pathologies when fed HF/HS for 16 weeks. As host genetics is known to shape the composition of the gut microbiome; the hypothesis of the present study is that a long-term consumption of the HF/HS diet may change the microbial abundance and diversity in CC042 and CC011. We assessed microbial abundance and diversity in the banked samples to dissect the role of long-term consumption (20, 40 and 60 weeks) of HF/HS diet in male and female CC042 and CC011 mice.  Fecal DNA was extracted using the ZYMO Research Fecal Nucleic Acids extraction kit. Intestinal-mucosal DNA was extracted using phenol;/chloroform/isopropanol.

Tolba,University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,,"Aiiryel K. McCoy, Andrew Igbokidi, Ryan M. Allen",University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,,,,,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. ASCVD begins with the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the vascular wall, where macrophages become engorged with these lipid-rich particles imparting a ‘foamy’ appearance. Foam cells define atherosclerotic lesions, which can naturally resolve, but often progress to complex atherosclerotic plaques of immune infiltrates, ectopic cholesterol, collagen fibers, and necrotic foam cells. Unstable plaques can rupture, generating thrombi that can cause heart attack or stroke. Reducing LDL is a primary intervention for ASCVD; however, gaps in understanding of LDL’s role in foam cell dysfunction present barriers to pharmacological innovation. Recent work has demonstrated that LDL transports small RNAs that activate toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8), a sensor of small RNA that mediates macrophage anti-viral responses. Here, we sought to examine the contribution of TLR8 to foam cell dysfunction. We developed two main objectives, (1) identify novel TLR8 interacting proteins and (2) determine whether TLR8 signals through the molecular target of rapamycin complex (mTORC). For the first objective, we have developed a proximity ligation strategy in which a split biotin ligase is fused to the cytosolic terminus of TLR8. Targeted proximity ligation near early (Rab5) or late (Rab7) endosomes will be validated, and LDL-stimulated TLR8-interacting proteins will be identified by mass spectrometry. For the second objective, we have used luciferase-based reporter assays to assess whether TLR8 activation alters cap-dependent translation, a key component of the mTORC pathway. Preliminary data indicates that LDL and TLR8 augment mTORC activity indirectly through the tumor suppressor protein p53, a key effector of necrotic cell death. Ongoing studies will define this relationship in macrophages in vitro and atherosclerotic plaques in vivo.",Omnivore,7/4/23 21:07,,,,,,Some Other Race,,,,,,,Some Other Race,,Male,,Male,,,,,,,,,P106,P106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glioblastoma is a type of glioma and the most aggressive form of cancer that originates from the brain. The common subtypes of glioblastoma are glioblastoma IDH wild type (wt) and IDH-mutated astrocytoma (mut), both of which come under grade IV tumors. Optical metabolic imaging technique like multiphoton microscopy (MPM) allows non-invasive, label-free, and quantitative tracking of events happening during cellular metabolism. Two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) from intrinsic fluorophores provides physiological and pathological information from biological tissues. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are two endogenous fluorescent coenzymes whose autofluorescence imaging, as well as fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) records changes during metabolism depending on their distributions and concentrations. Precisely, the optical reduction-oxidation (redox) ratio (ORR) of FAD/(FAD + NADH) provides a validated method to quantify the redox state of a cell.  Recent studies from our group have employed ORR to determine the relationship between cellular metabolism and metastatic potential in cancer cells for detecting response to radiation. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are the two frontline treatment methods following surgery for glioblastoma. Radiation therapy is usually effective when combined with chemotherapy.

Sleep deprivation is inducible in animals and is indiscriminate of age or sex. In our research, using the zebrafish model, we investigated the effects of sleep deprivation on decision-making and behavior in the presence of artificially induced schooling, using mirrors, in a complex maze. The goal of this research is to determine whether zebrafish are more inclined to give into innate socialization or if the driving force behind hunger is stronger, in addition, how are these results affected by sleep deprivation? Population sex composition was also altered in addition to the control and sleep-deprived conditions. Composition variations included both control and experimental groups of male-only, female-only, 50% male to female, female minority, and male minority populations. Testing of each group occurred over a five-day period, the first three days of initial testing were used to train and condition the fish to a consistent target area, and in the final two days mirrors were implemented and observations were recorded. Zebrafish are commonly known to be social animals and display schooling behavior. Zebrafish models have also been used to study learning and memory, therefore creating this artificial population would be used to cause a deterrence between the fish and the learned target area. All groups were able to successfully maneuver through obstructions and reach the target area, however, the amount of time taken to reach the target area increased; and interaction time with mirrors, schooling, and behavioral patterns varied between each group. Our findings suggest that sleep deprivation has an impact on socialization and decision-making, and a noticeable regression in the time it took to reach the target area was observed in all groups after the implementation of artificial schooling.",Omnivore,7/5/23 14:37,White,,,,,,,,"White alone, non-Hispanic",,,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,T2,P111,,T2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, the model integrates sex and age as covariates. We will visualize and compare the identified regions and frequency bands with existing findings to determine their potential relevance. We hypothesize that our model will be able to accurately classify the infants into their respective dietary groups, however, the accuracy will diminish throughout early childhood as other environmental influences are introduced.

Prior to the discovery and widespread use of antibiotics, bacteriophages were used to treat infections because of their specificity and replication abilities.  Once antibiotics became accepted as the standard approach to treat bacterial infections, bacteriophage-based treatments diminished in relevance; however, with the increasing difficulty to treat bacterial infections with antibiotics, a renewed interest has occurred in bacteriophage-based treatments.  While bacteriophages are typically used to combat existing infections, this study seeks to utilize bacteriophages to prevent infection.  In an effort to develop a product to prevent the onset of menstrual toxic shock syndrome caused by Staphylococcus aureus, we developed a cocktail containing two bacteriophages proven to inhibit the growth of S. aureus.  In order to find the most promising bacteriophage, 37 clinical S. aureus strains isolated from patients with TSS were examined for the presence of bacteriophages and their ability of those bacteriophages to be bactericidal on TSS-causing strains of S. aureus.  Bacteriophages, isolated from S. aureus strains NCH252 and NCH474, were identified with an ability to plaque, or create zones of clearing, on 85% percent of tested strains.

Digestion enzymes are required for conversion of proteins into peptides with trypsin being the most commonly used as it will cleave at every lysine and arginine residue. Traditionally, histone analysis by mass spectrometry has been limited, namely because of challenging protein isolation, the high lysine content, and a lack of capability in identifying PTMs. To combat these problems, we are proposing an acid extraction which isolates basic proteins, including histones. A propionyl anhydride derivatization which adds a propionyl group to every amino group thus preventing trypsin from cleaving at lysine residues.

Burkholderia cenocepacia AU1054 was serially diluted, and inoculation volumes of 10, 20, 100, and 200 mL were used to target detection of 100, 10, and 1 colony-forming unit (CFU)/L. The samples were cultured at 30 °C for 48 hours in 1/10 TSB and turbidity, as a measure of positive/negative growth, was assessed using optical density (OD600 nm). The results were then confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using BCC specific primer. Preliminary findings show that the target organism can be recovered at least 90% using 10 mL inoculation volume from 100 CFU/mL, whereas less than 30% recovery rate was observed in 10 CFU/L samples. In contrast, when 100 mL inoculation volume was used, more than 50% recovery rate can be observed in 10 CFU/mL samples. Moreover, a 200 mL sample volume can invariably lead to the detection of as low as 1 CFU/L, regardless of the nature of the water source. These results highlight the importance of collecting adequate volumes of samples using the traditional culture method for more sensitive detection of BCC.",Omnivore,7/5/23 12:31,,,,Asian,,,,,,,Asian alone,,,,Female,Female,,,,,,,,,P117,,P117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
