Xanax, commonly referred to as alprazolam, is an anti-anxiety benzodiazepine drug commonly prescribed to treat short-term anxiety. Alprazolam is the most prescribed psychiatric drug. Overdoses caused by alprazolam often occur when combined with illicit drugs. Some illicit drugs which substance abuse users use to cope with anxiety are synthetic cannabinoids. Synthetic cannabinoids are commonly known as K2 or spice and induce a “high” similar to cannabis, but cause significant adverse side effects, such as cardiovascular issues. Synthetic cannabinoid use has also surged to where this class of illicit drugs account for a third of all new psychoactive drugs. Users often mix alprazolam with synthetic cannabinoids, which could lead to increased adverse effects including death due to the drug-to-drug interactions. There is very little research being done on drug-to-drug interaction mechanisms for synthetic cannabinoids in general, and none involving alprazolam. In response, this project was designed to study possible drug-to-drug interactions between the synthetic cannabinoid 5F-APINACA and alprazolam in humans based on steady-state kinetics studies using human liver microsomes. Our hypothesis is adding alprazolam will inhibit the metabolism of 5F-APINACA because both drugs are metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme. This inhibition will lead to toxicity in users due to the elevated levels of both 5F-APINACA and alprazolam. Previous work done in the lab has identified the kinetics of 5F-APINACA in human liver microsomes, and upon adding diazepam (another benzodiazepine), the metabolism of 5F-APINACA was severally hindered. We will be testing our hypothesis by measuring and comparing the uninhibited kinetic data for 5F-APINACA using human liver microsomes, and then the kinetics after adding alprazolam.",T2,T2,,,Omnivore

Therefore, controlling this pathway is important for cancer therapies. Growth factor Receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) is critical for linking activated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) to the Ras-MAPK cascade. We reported that GRB2 exists in monomer-dimer equilibrium, where only monomeric GRB2 (mGRB2) binds the mammalian homologue of drosophila son of sevenless (SOS) and activates MAPK, while the dimeric GRB2 (dGRB2) is inhibitory to this process. The self-association/dissociation of GRB2 represents a switch that regulates MAP kinase activity and hence controls cancer progression. Therefore chemical stabilizers of dGRB2 assembly will inhibit Ras/MAPK signaling. We have successfully identified small molecule dGRB2 stabilizers that induce apoptosis by inhibiting Ras/MAPK in multiple cell-lines. To improve cellular exposure of the dGRB2 stabilizers, we developed a bioisosteric replacement strategy for the urea functional group. The synthesis of these novel analogues for dGRB2 stabilization is presented",P2,,,P2,Omnivore

Appleton,Harding University,,Savannah Ewing,Harding Universtiy,,David Donley,Harding University,,"Free radical signaling and oxidation-reduction (redox) pathways are important inflammatory signaling mechanisms. Microglia are the primary immune cells of the Central Nervous System (CNS) that mediation inflammatory processes in the brain. Dysregulation of redox pathways promotes disease-associated oxidative stress and CNS degeneration. Recently, the pro-oxidant enzyme, myeloperoxidase (MPO) has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease progression but little is known about its role in neuroinflammation. The goal of this study was to characterize the role of MPO on inflammatory responses of microglia to disease-relevant stimuli. In Alzheimer’s disease, amyloid-beta-42 (Aβ-42) and elevated iron are both associated with elevated brain inflammation. We found that MPO activity is increased in cultured microglia after Aβ-42and iron stimulation. To address the role of MPO, we treated immortalized microglial cells with the MPO inhibitor (MPOi) in the presence and absence of activating stimuli. We found that the MPO decreases glycolic activity in both Aβ-42-stimulated and unstimulated cells. Since metabolic activity is a determinant of activation state, we measured the effect of MPO inhibition on production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We found that MPO inhibition decreased cytokine production, suggesting that MPO contributes to inflammatory processes. Interestingly, we found that MPO inhibition had little effect on production of reactive oxygen species after iron and Aβ-42 stimulation These results indicate that MPO may be an indirect mediator of inflammation in microglia. Further research is needed to determine the interplay between MPO and disease-relevant stimuli and how MPO shapes the redox state of the cell. Further research is needed to determine the interplay between MPO and disease-relevant stimuli and how MPO shapes the redox state of the cell. This work will impact our understanding of the role of MPO as a biomarker for disease and mediator of inflammation. ",T1,,,,Omnivore

Chronic METH use can also contribute to severe tissue damage in the liver which can lead to cirrhosis, hepatitis, and other liver diseases. This inflammation is partly mediated by METH binding to Toll-like receptor TLR-4, which induces a proinflammatory response in cells. We are pursuing pioglitazone (PIO) as a proposed treatment to mitigate the harsh effects METH causes with tissue degeneration, neurotoxicity, and liver toxicity. PIO is a PPAR-y agonist which supports anti-inflammatory response and inhibits TLR-4 which can lead to a lessened impact of chronic METH-induced inflammation.  We hypothesize that in an in vivo rat model of METH chronic use, PIO can mitigate METH-induced proinflammatory cytokine and protein expression in the liver. We performed a behavioral model where 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned 4 different treatments (vehicle/vehicle, vehicle/METH, PIO/METH, and PIO/vehicle over the course of 20 days. During this time the rats were measured for locomotor sensitization, and after the study tissues were collected. For my project I am analyzing liver tissues via western blotting to test for protein expression of important pathway proteins such as TLR-4, PPAR-y and key inflammatory cytokines. Overall, we expect to see a PIO-mediated decrease in METH-induced inflammation which could indicate that PIO might have a protective effect on major organ systems",P3,,P3,,Omnivore

HELB is known to bind to Replication Protein A (RPA), which accumulates on single stranded DNA at stalled replication forks and at double stranded breaks. According to genome-wide association studies, a mutant of HELB (D506G) is strongly associated with a decreased natural age at menopause. Early age at menopause increases the risk for heart disease and decreases the risk for breast cancer. Despite knowledge about the impact of this HELB mutant, knowledge about how it affects HELB’s functions is lacking. This D506G mutation is in an acidic region of HELB necessary for RPA interaction. The mutation is also located within the conserved helicase domain of HELB and has the potential to affect folding of the protein into the correct structure. The long-term goal of this project is to purify wild-type and D506G HELB and compare enzymatic activity and ability to interact with RPA. Wild-type HELB was successfully produced by transfection of HEK293T cells and affinity purification. Studying how the D506G mutation impacts the function of HELB is a step towards uncovering the connection between the HELB D506G mutation and early natural menopause. ",T3,,,,Herbivore (Vegetarian)

According to the CDC, in 2020 AR ranked 46th in the US in infant mortality rate (IMR). Using Arkansas All-Payers Claims Database (APCD), we linked Arkansas birth and death certificates with medical claims data to examine if maternal mental and behavioral health (MBH) has any impact on IMR. Our preliminary analyses using logistic regression  shows infants whose mothers smoked cigarettes during pregnancy are 17.9% (OR: 1.179, CI: (0.068, 0.263)) more likely to die within the first 2 years of life and infants with an abnormal meconium screening at birth are 20.4% (OR: 1.204, CI: (-0.0568, 0.429)) more likely to die within the first 2 years of life. Additionally, significant racial disparities exist in IMR in different regions of Arkansas as black infants were over three times as likely (OR: 3.55, CI: (0.51, 2.02)) to die within the first 2 years of life as opposed to white infants. In conclusion, maternal prenatal substance use is associated with higher infant mortality rates in Arkansas. Racial and regional disparities also exist in infant mortality in Arkansas. Our ongoing efforts are focused on more in depth analyses into other maternal factors associated with both increase and decrease in IMR over the last 5 years.",P4,,,P4,Omnivore

One P-gp substrate, norbuprenorphine (NorBUP), is an active metabolite of buprenorphine (BUP), the first-line treatment for opioid use disorder in pregnancy. Evidence suggests that NorBUP substantially contributes to neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) caused by BUP treatment during pregnancy. Elacridar is an inhibitor of both P-gp and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRA), another ATPase efflux transporter. Our lab previously determined that co-administration of Elacridar with a subthreshold dose of NorBUP to pregnant rats increased NOWS in their pups and fetal brain concentrations of NorBUP (relative to NorBUP alone). The purpose of this project is to confirm that this effect of Elacridar was specifically caused by modulation of P-gp expression and/or activity, rather than by another efflux transporter like BCRA. To accomplish this, we will isolate brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) from the placenta harvested on gestation day (GD) 20 from pregnant rats that received either no treatment (control), treatment with NorBUP (0.3 mg/kg/day, s.c., minipump, GD 9-20), or NorBUP treatment plus Elacridar (10 mg/kg, s.c., twice daily, GD 17-20). P-gp expression will be compared between these groups using Western blotting. We will quantify P-gp activity by measuring ATP-dependent [3H]-Digoxin uptake by inside-out vesicles. We will determine the proportions of inside-out vesicles (relative to total) using an NPPase activity assay. We anticipate that P-gp activity will be reduced in Elacridar-exposed placenta, explaining the reduction in NOWS and fetal brain concentration of NorBUP when NorBUP and Elacridar are co-administered. This work is important for understanding placental P-gp as a modifiable target that modulates fetal NorBUP exposure and can thus affect NOWS severity. ",P5,,P5,,Omnivore

The female athlete triad is a condition which low energy availability negatively effect’s menstrual function and bone mineral density. Long term, this condition can predispose females to infertility and osteoporosis if not properly treated. Currently, the most effective treatment for athletes within the triad is to regain menstruation through adequate dietary nutrient intake. Many athletes take supplements to combat nutritional deficiencies; however, supplements are not regulated and do not provide the additional caloric energy needed to help restabilize menstruation. The goal of this study was to create a high protein product, using diverse protein sources, that encourages fueling through food to help combat the female athlete triad using food 3D printing. Food 3D printing technology is showing advancements toward providing individualized nutrition in food products while upholding individual texture and taste preferences. This study used Foodini 3D food printer to develop a foundational formula for a protein bar aimed at offering the nutrients needed to combat and prevent the female athlete triad.  The foundational formula makes a bar with a jelly layer in the center and consists of 27.6g of carbs, 6.3g of protein, and 9.3g of total fats. Using the foundational formula, six bars were made adding in different types of protein powder: whey, pea, rice, almond, egg white, and cricket protein powder.  Nutritional values can be varied by printing different sized bars. Ongoing studies include rheological testing of each bar to explore how each protein powder effects the bars physical properties, as well as consumer acceptance for each bar. Future studies will be able to further develop the protein bar to incorporate nutrients based on individual needs.",P6,,,P6,Omnivore

They are excellent tools to study host species barrier and host immunity, due to their dependence of host machinery and ability of successfully inhibiting and manipulating host pathways. Poxviruses encode a unique group of genes, called host range determinants, to maintain and expand their host range tropism. Vaccinia Virus (VACV) known as the vaccine for the eradication of small pox, has a gene called C7L, which is a known example of a host range determinant. Although VACV C7L is nonessential for viral replication, it is important to inhibit host innate immune response against VACV infection during pathogenesis. The aim of this study is to investigate the biophysical properties of C7 protein, by cloning it into a bacterial vector and enriching it to high purity. Through restriction digestion, we prepared the recipient vector for the cloning. With polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction digestion, we generated the insert construct and then lighted it into the prepared recipient vector. After sequencing confirmation, we then transformed the bacterial expression host with the correct construct for protein production. Our cloning resulted in at least three correct clones. We are now purifying the protein for biophysical analyses, using dynamic light scattering test (DLS) and circular dichroism (CD). The results in comparison with other viral proteins of the same family will provide new information on how these viral proteins behave in the liquid form and interacts with itself and other molecules. Combined with our data of molecular virology, pathogenesis, and proteomics, we will gain new insight on how viral proteins evade host immunity through evolutionary divergency.",T5,,,,Omnivore

Plant elicitor peptides (Peps) are produced by plants in response to pathogens and other stresses, and they activate the plant’s immune response to fight off infection. Artificially delivering “extra” doses of a plant’s own Peps can provide extra protection against pathogens. Several Peps including GmPep1, GmPep2, and GmPep3 have been identified in soybean. When they are synthesized in vitro and applied to soybean seeds, they can reduce subsequent nematode infections on soybean seedlings. However, there is a need for other methods to deliver Peps throughout the plant’s life cycle rather than just at the seed stage. One possible delivery method would be to use plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) such as Bacillus subtilis, which grow in close association with plant roots. A recent study in potato has shown that B. subtilis can be used to express and excrete Peps, and the Goggin laboratory has also developed a B. subtilis strain expressing GmPEP3 for pest management on soybean. However, it is important to test whether this Pep delivery strategy might have any beneficial or negative side-effects on plant growth. PGPRs typically promote root growth whereas some but not all studies report that Pep applications can inhibit root elongation. The objectives of my study are to measure the effects of  B. subtilis expressing GmPEP3 on plant growth, and to compare these effects to those of B. subtilis or GmPep3 treatments alone. To assess plant growth, I am using image-based phenotyping to measure root morphology in addition to assessing germination rates, above- and below-ground biomass, and other measures of plant vigor.

These fibers are ideal for wound healing as they mimic the primary characteristics of the extracellular matrix. Additionally, the natural polymer chitosan can be co-spun into fiber mats increasing the antimicrobial properties of the materials thereby reducing the risk of infection. Incorporating macromolecular therapeutics like proteins has the potential to enhance and accelerate the wound healing process. It is anticipated that introducing an external source of thrombin via fiber mats will promote a faster clotting time and ultimately promote better tissue regeneration. Thrombin is an ideal clotting factor for biomedical applications because it will induce a cellular response whether the pathway is intrinsic or extrinsic. The engineered protein s-FGF1 stimulates fibroblast activity thereby promoting an environment that is favorable for healing. This cascade from fibroblast activity ultimately produces an increase in native collagen that sustains healing. The first objective of this research is to optimize the chitosan and PVA formulation to yield a fiber mat with the highest possible amount of chitosan while maintaining the integrity of the fiber mat so that it is uniform in density and free of imperfections. Imperfections in the fibers may lead to an uneven distribution of fiber mat additives (e.g., co-polymers, therapeutics). Utilizing uniform fibers will allow for a better understanding of cellular responses to the engineered fiber mats. The second objective of this research is to integrate optimized fiber mats with proteins such as thrombin and s-FGF1.

However, once absorbed into the bloodstream, lead is deposited largely into the liver, which comprises around one third of soft tissue in the body. When lead gets into liver tissue, free radicals like reactive oxygen species (ROS) are created in the mitochondria, causing DNA oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and protein damage. This study focuses on observing effects of lead-induced oxidative stress and free radical production in mitochondria of immortalized non-primary Clone-9 rat endothelial liver cells. Lead oxidizes glutathione (GSH) and also inhibits glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), all of which are used in a coupled reaction in the pentose phosphate pathway, responsible for NADPH production. Study goal: The aim of the current study is to assess the extent lead affects cellular toxicity, glutathione levels, and mitochondrial function to observe oxidative stress. Methods: Non-primary immortalized endothelial rat Clone-9 cells were plated for growth curves and clonogenic survival before being treated with differing concentrations of lead acetate to test toxicity.

Enormous amounts of energy can be produced from a miniscule amount of natural oil. Furthermore, plastics derived from fossil fuels have become so interwoven with everyday life that it’s unfathomable to imagine a world without it. While fossil fuels have served many beneficial purposes, there have also been massive consequences, such as producing excess CO2 that has been recycled back into the Earth's atmosphere, causing record high temperatures, wildlife destruction, and air pollution. Electrochemically reducing CO2 into CO using a manganese catalyst allows alternative fuel sources to be produced. 2,6-bis(1-methyl benzimidazol-2-yl)pyridine (MeBim-py) is the ligand that attaches to manganese pentacarbonyl bromide allowing carbon dioxide to be reduced. The reduction potential for this process will be measured by cyclic voltammetry. N-(2-pyridyl)benzimidazole (Bim-py) is first synthesized by combining 2-bromopyridine, benzimidazole, potassium carbonate, a solvent and then microwaved allowing the process to take less than thirty minutes.

ROS and RNS neutralize pathogens by damaging proteins, lipids, and DNA. Proteins that contain iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters are particularly susceptible to damage by nitric oxide (NO), a common RNS. FeS clusters are found ubiquitously in nature and have a wide range of functions that underlie essential biological processes including transcriptional and translational regulation, DNA replication genome maintenance, and metabolism. Disruption of FeS activity leads to inactivation of proteins and eventually cell death. One essential bacterial response system utilizes non-heme diiron enzymes that facilitate the direct repair of FeS centers following exposure to oxidative or nitrosative stress. Genes from this repair of iron cluster (RIC) class of metalloproteins have been identified in several pathogenic bacteria and are upregulated upon exposure to NO and hydrogen peroxide. Of this class of proteins, the E. coli RIC-protein YtfE is the best characterized. YtfE has been shown to reduce NO to N2O, protecting the bacteria from nitrosative stress. Here, we measured kinetic rates of NO reduction by YtfE using UV-visible spectroscopy. Catalytic turnover rates suggest that YtfE is not an efficient NO reducer, suggesting that this is not the primary function of YtfE.",P12,,,P12,Omnivore

Dunlap,University of Central Arkansas,,"PEP-19 is a small, intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that regulates the binding response of Calmodulin (CaM) to calcium. Calmodulin is a central translator to the calcium ion signal. It affects up to more than 300 target proteins when in the presence of calcium. PEP-19’s involvement with the calcium signaling process is to bind to CaM and increase the rate of calcium ion C-terminal lobe of CaM. PEP-19 has shown decreased levels in the brain in Parkinson’s disease and there is an increase of PEP-19 in brain area spared in Alzheimer’s disease. The presence of PEP-19 appears to help protect against calcium overload. Our preliminary studies have suggested that PEP-19’s conformation when bound to Ca2+-CaM shows more helix, and is more compact, than when PEP-19 is bound to apo-CaM. Because the C-terminal half of PEP-19 is helical when bound to either apo- or Ca2+ CaM, we hypothesized that the extra helix seen in Ca2+ - CaM bound PEP-19 is in the N-terminal half of PEP-19. For investigation, we used circular dichroism spectropolarimetry of PEP- 19, the C-terminal of PEP-19, and CaM, with and without calcium to determine where the extra helix is located in PEP-19.",P13,,P13,,Omnivore

Putative G4 forming sequences are found frequently in portions of the genome with important regulatory functions. Folding of G4 structures can cause replication stress by preventing access to the genetic information within the quadruplex. Rev1, a Y-family polymerase, helps the cell combat G4-related replicative stress through a multi-faceted mechanism of action. The Eoff lab recently used a mass spectrometry-based approach to study Rev1-dependent interactions in the G4 replisome. They discovered that loss of Rev1 leads to the accumulation of proteins involved in fork reversal and recombination-mediated fork restart in cells treated with the G4 stabilizing compound pyridostatin (PDS). One of the proteins enriched at sites of DNA synthesis in REV1KO cells was the Rad5 homolog Helicase-Like Transcription Factor (HLTF), a key enzyme involved in fork reversal. The goal of my summer project is to validate the proteomics results by using chromatin fractionation and proximity ligation assays to determine if HLTF is indeed more abundant near sites of G4 replication in REV1KO cells. A long-term goal of this project is to determine if fork reversal compensates for defective translesion synthesis past G4 motifs and whether this response adequately maintains the genetic and epigenetic features necessary for the biological functions of these non-B-form DNA structures.",P15,,P15,,Omnivore

During elongation, FACT – which in S. cerevisiae is composed of two proteins, Spt16 and Pob3 – contributes to the disassembly of nucleosomes in front of Pol II and to their reassembly following Pol II passage.  In previous work we identified a nucleosomal region – termed ISGI (Influences Spt16-Gene Interactions) – that plays an important role in promoting proper interactions between FACT and transcribed genes.   More specifically, mutations within this region cause an accumulation of FACT at the 3’ ends of genes, an effect we attribute to impaired FACT dissociation from genes following transcription.   Two recent studies have unveiled an association between a mutation within one of the two genes that encode the human histone H3.3 protein and neurodevelopmental disorders in patients.  This mutation results in a substitution of the ISGI residue L61 to an arginine (H3.3-L61R), and, if this mutation is indeed responsible for the disease phenotype, it must act in a dominant fashion since the genomes of these patients also harbor three alleles encoding wild type histone H3.3.  Our work in yeast has shown that most substitutions at H3-L61 cause strong defects in Spt16-gene interactions, but the H3-L61R mutant had not yet been tested since it does not sustain viability on its own.  In the present study, we tested H3-L61R for possible dominant effects in conferring defects in Spt16-gene interactions and found that it not only operates in a dominant fashion, but it does so also in cells that express the mutant protein from one of four histone H3-encoding alleles.  These results, combined with other studies linking loss of function mutations in human Spt16 and neurodevelopmental disorders, provide a possible molecular mechanism underlying the development disorders seen in patients expressing the histone H3.3-L61R mutant.",P16,,,P16,Omnivore

Interestingly, evidence also indicates that methionine restriction can lead to an increase in cellular lifespan. Although the exact mechanism that causes this paradox is poorly understood, some research indicates that methionine restriction causes an increase in autophagy. Autophagy is a mechanism that cells utilize to recycle damaged organelles. It is also believed that methionine signals through mTOR, a protein kinase, to promote cellular growth and inhibit autophagy. This study aims to further explore the link between mTOR and autophagy in methionine-restricted cancer cells. In this project, we are using a wild-type murine melanoma cell line with autophagy-deficient knockouts of the genes Atg5 and Atg7. Normal fibroblast cell lines were used as a control. We will investigate the mTOR and autophagy pathways with protein expression using Western blots; gene expression will be investigated with quantitative real-time PCR. The cell lines were cultured in either control (200mM methionine) or methionine restricted (5mM methionine) media. By further investigating the mechanisms that cancer cells use to grow, therapies can be developed that exploit these mechanisms. ",P17,,P17,,Omnivore

Because BPA is able to bind to and activate estrogen receptors, it is linked to reduced fertility, altered development, and hormone-related cancers. A recent study at NYU Medical School confirmed the presence of BPA in pantiliners, pads, tampons, feminine washes and deodorants. This is concerning due to the high absorption capacity of the vulvar skin. For the research performed in our lab this summer, the goal was to determine if fluorescence spectrophotometry could be used to determine the presence of BPA in feminine hygiene products by monitoring the release of BPA over time into a solution of 50% methanol/water. Fluorescence is a sensitive, selective and affordable method of analysis, and BPA is a fluorescent compound that absorbs energy at 278 nm and emits at 304 nm. First, a calibration curve was obtained and analytical figures of merit were determined: linear range, limit of detection and limit of quantitation. Due to the complex sample matrix and the small concentrations of BPA in these products, the standard addition method was employed for analysis. Pantyliners, tampons and tampon applicators were tested for the presence of BPA. The top/outside layer of the feminine hygiene product which comes into direct contact with skin was removed and cut into small pieces. In the case of applicators, the entire applicator was utilized. Samples were then placed into beakers containing 100 mL of 50% methanol/water solution, one per time point to be tested from 0 minutes to 6 hours. At each time point, aliquots of sample solution were removed and transferred to 25-mL volumetric flasks containing various concentrations of BPA stock solution. Fluorescence emission intensities at 304 nm were obtained in quadruplicate, and standard addition graphs were utilized to determine how much BPA had leached from the sample over time.

Using the natural fluorescence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) acquired through two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy of skin in vivo, the mitochondrial fractal dimension was calculated with a recently established Modified Blanket Method. This method allowed for rapid calculation of local fractal dimension by quantifying how the surface area values of autofluorescence intensity images scale with pixel size. Our results demonstrate that the epidermis of aged mice contains a higher mitochondrial fractal dimension than young mice.

However, pancreatic cancer ranks among the highest in mortality in spite of the research done so far.  Treatment usually involves surgery if the cancer is localized  and resectable; if it is not resectable, a course of either chemotherapy and/or radiation is prescribed to either reduce the tumor to a resectable range.  Due to naturally occurring DNA repair mechanisms in pancreatic cancers, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have reduced effectiveness.  One prominent mechanism includes the oncogene KRAS, in which cells upregulate DNA repair mechanisms.  RAD18, which codes for E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, appears to be linked with KRAS, and plays a role in post-replication repair of damaged DNA.  The experiments showed a marked reduction in RAD18 expression when KRAS was silenced.  Furthermore, knockdown of RAD18 results in increased radiosensitivity in the cell lines observed when treated with 2-6 Gy of radiation.",P21,,P21,,Omnivore

Most of the proteomics work is now done through core labs such as the IDeA National Resource for Quantitate proteomics which uses nano-LC coupled to Orbitrap mass spectrometers to obtain quantitative information on peptides. It is significant to conduct complete, reproducible protein extraction from the starting level of the sample because due to the dynamic range of the proteome, it always has a ‘dark corner’ of the proteome where MS has difficulty detecting. Single-pot, solid-phase sample preparation (SP3) has been a remarkable lysate digestion method in which organic solvent and magnetic beads denature and capture proteins while removing any contaminant. However, SP3 potentially loses peptides during wash steps, and magnetic beads may contaminate the samples and MS instruments. To complement the limitations of SP3, the Solvent Precipitation SP3 method (SP4) was developed, which omits magnetic beads instead of magnets and uses a high organic solvent to capture protein from cell lysates. Recent studies in SP4 methods showed that glass beads, the alternative to magnetic beads, promote more elevated reproductive protein recovery. Also, SP4 is cost-effective as by omitting magnetic beads, SP4 does not require any specialized equipment and reagents. In this project, we build the plate-based SP4 using a positive pressure manifold for the high throughput method. Compare the plate-based SP4 with traditional protein digestion methods such as CME and SP3; a decent amount of protein IDs were detected in all three different methods.

Pericytes are found in the neurovascular unit, along with endothelial cells, microglia, and astrocytes. These cells are situated within the blood-brain barrier and reinforce its structure, remove toxicity from the brain, and manage blood flow. In this study, the presence of pericytes were evaluated in non-transgenic rat and transgenic or AD rat. These rats were injected with Fluoro-Ruby-dextran, a retrograde tracer, in both lateral brain ventricles to observe pericytes. With this method, it was determined there was a significantly larger presence of pericytes in the prefrontal cortex of the non-transgenic rats than the AD rats. This was evidenced by the non-transgenic rats having area fractions of pericytes that were 0.00318, for male populations, and 0.00711, for female populations, greater than the AD rats. Effect of AD was significant in the hippocampus of the female rat than their male counterparts. Fluoro-gold (FG), another retrograde tracer, was used to label endothelial cells in the brain.

Lectin, a marker for blood vessels, showed that the microvessel in AD rats were ischemic and shorter in length compared to wild type rats. Lectin also showed vascular inflammation in AD rat brains, due to its ability to label inflamed microglia. In contrast, the non-transgenic rat brains had healthier microvasculature.

Only bacteria and archaea possess nitrogenase. The nitrogen fixation pathway is well documented in bacteria, with each step associated with a gene or set of genes; however, the pathway is less understood within Archaea. NifB controls the formation of Iron-Sulfur clusters within the Nitrogen fixation pathway associated with nitrogenase. Specifically, it is unknown what gene codes for the protein that brings the precursor clusters to NifB, and the exact purpose of NifB within methanogens – a type of Archaea - other than producing the more complicated FeS cluster. Previous attempts to delete NifB from the species Methanosarcina acetivorans have proved unfruitful and providing the organism with ammonia does not prevent the expression of NifB. To test the hypothesis that NifB has other uses within methanogens and to discover what protein provides the precursor clusters, the goal of this project is to express NifB with an N-terminal strep tag in M. acetivorans to facilitate purification to aid in discover of proteins that interact with NifB. After performing PCR of the modified nifB and purification of the plasmid pNB730, digestion and ligation was performed to anneal the strep-nifB into the plasmid.

We observed oncogenic overexpression of MED12 in core-binding factor (CBF) subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in reference to a patient cohort (N=1250), as available at the dbGAP repository (phs000465.v19. p8). MED12 expression was also positively correlated to the expression of its MED-kinase complex partner cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK8). Based on our observation, we screened the putative efficacy of a type-I CDK8 inhibitor (CDK8i) BI-1347 against two CBF AML cell lines such as M07e and KASUMI-1, compared to non-CBF AML lines such as MV4;11, and MOLM13 using luminescence-based cell viability assays. We obtained the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) against BI-1347 at a concentration of 70 nM (R2=0.87) in MOLM13, and 397 nM (R2=0.9) in MV4;11. In contrast, poor correlations were observed between the BI-1347 concentration and percentage of cell viability in CBF-AML lines such that IC50 against M07e was obtained at >1 µM (R2=0.3) and against KASUMI-1 at >9 µM (R2=0.5). The subsequent western blots from treated samples revealed that BI-1347 effectively reduced the CDK8 expression in non-CBF-AML lines. In contrast, there have been negligible changes observed in CDK8 expression among the CBF-AML lines in response to the CDK8i. Most interestingly, we observed high MED12 expression in CBF-AML lines, where the protein expression was null in the non-CBF-AML lines. Based on our observation, we conclude that MED12 plays a critical role in determining resistance to the CDK8is, which warrants further exploration. ",T6,T6,,,Omnivore

Our previous work showed that these tumor cells are highly addicted to the overexpression of several pro-survival oncogenes, particularly MCL1. MCL1 is a member of the BCL2 gene family, which functions to prevent intrinsic apoptosis and has been implicated in several cancers. Despite the overlapping functions of the BCL2 family, the tumor cells are only dependent on MCL1. Our initial hypothesis was that MCL1 performs non-canonical roles unrelated to apoptosis. However, here we present that this selective addiction is mainly dictated by the expression levels of the gene family. Reanalysis of published RNA-seq data indicates that BCL2 gene family expression is significantly skewed towards MCL1. We postulate that altering these ratios will cause the tumor cells to depend on a different BCL2 gene. We, therefore, individually overexpressed the BCL2 family members using lentiviral vectors in the PEL cell line, BC-1. We assessed how these cell lines resisted cell death triggered by a general apoptotic inducer, staurosporine (STS), and a highly specific inhibitor for MCL1 (S63845, MCL1i). Our results show that overexpression of other BCL2 family members can substantially buffer against the detrimental effects of both STS and MCL1i. BCL2 family members ultimately rescued cell viability and reduced apoptosis as measured by Caspase 3/7 activity. Together our data indicate that the expression levels of the BCL2 family likely explain why the PEL tumor cells are highly addicted to MCL1. More importantly, our results suggest that caution should be taken when considering MCL1i  as a single treatment regimen for cancer, as resistance to this class of inhibitor can easily develop.",P27,,P27,,Omnivore

An important facet of the DDR is the recruitment of initial effector proteins to modulate and initiate downstream signaling effects which initiate the timely and accurate repair of specific DNA lesions. This recruitment is mediated in part by protein interactions with histone tails, a component of the nucleosome complex which organizes and mediates DNA and DNA related processes. Based on preliminary data obtained by the Leung lab, we hypothesize that the repair protein 53BP1 directly interacts with the histone H2AX C-terminal tail. In this study, we will evaluate this interaction through in vitro pulldown assays using purified recombinant MBP-tagged 53BP1 fragments together with chemically synthesized H2AX C-terminal tail fragments (Genscript). Our 53BP1 fragments will include domain deletions and amino acid mutagenesis to identify the molecular detail necessary for this interaction. These assays will determine the minimal domains necessary within 53BP1 for the interaction between 53BP1 and the H2AX C-terminal tail.

Because cholesterol production in neurons is dependent on signaling from insulin levels throughout the body, the decreased levels of insulin from diabetes interrupts signaling and reduces cholesterol in neurons. Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is a protein understood to have control over energy homeostasis and appetite, and it is subjected to this decreased cholesterol in neurons associated with diabetes. This research aims to observe how decreased cholesterol in neurons affects MC4R’s location and function through creating an adenovirus that will express hemagglutinin-tagged MC4R in hypothalamic neurons. To do so, a plasmid encoding HA-MC4R-GFP was created by adding an HA tag to human MC4R and sub-cloning into the pEGFP-N2 plasmid. The HA tag, human influenza hemagglutinin peptide, allowed for antibodies specific to HA to target and bind to the tag to reveal MC4R’s location through immunofluorescence. HA-MC4R-GFP was digested to remove HA-MC4R and the adenovirus Synapsin AAV2 was digested to make space to insert the HA-MC4R. Synapsin AAV2 was chosen because the synapsin promoter allows for the expression of MC4R in neurons and using an adenovirus is a reliable method to express foreign proteins in mammalian cells. After HA-MC4R and Synapsin AAV2 were digested, the ligation of the two plasmids was prepared. A PCR reaction with HA-MC4R and primers that had homologous overlaps of the Synapsin vector was done to make a HA-MC4R insert to ligate to the vector. The ligation was next followed by a cell transformation. DNA was then extracted, purified, and confirmed to be the HA-MC4R Synapsin through gel electrophoresis. With the successful construction of an adenovirus containing HA-MC4R, next is to introduce the adenovirus to HEK cells to generate AAV2 particles for transducing neurons to be able to observe the effects of lower cholesterol on MC4R expression in neurons.",P31,,P31,,Omnivore

The process of proteomics involves digesting proteins into peptides and analyzing those peptides on an LC-MS (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry) instrument. Proteomic analyses must be high-throughput, cost efficient, and time efficient; as such, new procedures that better fit these criteria are being developed to replace old methods. One method of digesting proteins can be performed in a polyacrylamide gel following electrophoresis. Traditionally, gel lanes were cut into smaller pieces and desalted, reduced, alkylated, and digested in separate Eppendorf tubes. In this study, the traditional method of digesting gels is compared with a more modern, instrument-aided plate-based gel digestion using a positive pressure manifold. This method proved superior to the traditional method in terms of time efficiency, as well as yielding less sample contamination. Scaffold, a protein sample comparison software, was used to analyze the differences between the traditional and plate-based methods. It was determined that the plate-based method provided more consistency of types of proteins and equal or better amounts (or intensities) of protein compared to the traditional method. Due to automation, this method is much more time efficient and high-throughput than the traditional method of in-gel protein digestion. ",T8,T8,,,Omnivore

Exosomes play an integral role in cellular communication via transportation of various signaling molecules, including proteins, lipids, DNA, and mRNA. In cancer, it is postulated that sEVS drive tumor growth; they aid in malignant cell signaling, resulting in increased carcinogenesis. Here, we hypothesized that tumor cell-derived sEVs could also act in a paracrine manner and enhance tumor angiogenesis. To assess this, sEVs of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and radiation-resistant (RR) LLC were isolated through ultra-centrifugation and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Subsequently, they were used in 2H11 endothelial cell viability assays. A dose-response was observed using 0, 10, 20 and 40 µg/mL concentrations of LLC and LLC-RR sEVs, indicating that higher concentrations of sEVs increased endothelial cell viability over 72 hours. These observations support our hypothesis that tumor cell-derived sEVs promote tumor angiogenesis in a paracrine manner. Further experiments are ongoing to characterize the proteomic expression of canonical markers, tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD81 by Western Blotting. Additionally, the functional effects of LLC and LLC-RR-derived sEVs will be assessed on endothelial cell migration and tube formation, hallmarks of tumor angiogenesis. In the future, we aim to load these tumor-derived sEVs with lung cancer-specific treatments to determine the homing and therapeutic potential of these specialized sEVs to inhibit lung cancer.

However, 10% of the soybean crop is lost to disease annually. With increasing pressures on the global food supply due to factors such as population growth and climate change, it is important to protect crop yield by mitigating disease causing biotic stressors.  Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS) is a key cause of yield loss from disease in soybeans. SDS is caused by a fungal pathogen, Fusarium virguliforme. Currently, the methods for management are limited to tolerant cultivars complemented by a narrow range of fungicides. SDS progression can be hindered by certain microbes in the rhizosphere, the area of root-soil interaction. Thus, the goal of the current study is to use functional genomic approaches to measure the activity of these soil-borne microbes in the presence/absence of SDS in tolerant and susceptible cultivars. Therefore, one of the objectives of the study was to use Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) mediated screening to find soil samples devoid of F. virguliforme.  Once this was established I also used PCR to amplify a marker gene in F. virguliforme culture to find its purity. The screened soil was then used to grow the two soybean cultivars for our experiment. These plants were separated into two groups: F. virguliforme inoculated and mock (sterile water-inoculated).
We are in the process of collecting soil at four time points from the rhizosphere of the plants.  We will then isolate DNA and RNA to measure microbial diversity, abundance, and gene activity at each time point. This data will tell us how different cultivars affect microbiome and how the presence of F. virguliforme affects those changes. This data will then be used to find more durable and environmentally friendly solutions to SDS.",P34,,,P34,Omnivore

This increase is caused by genetic and/or environmental factors; including estrogenic endocrine disruptors that interfere with hormonal processes. Studies indicate that prenatal exposure to the ubiquitous environmental estrogen bisphenol A (BPA) increase the risk of developing childhood asthma. Preliminary studies in mice suggest that prenatal exposure to BPA, followed by allergic sensitization with ovalbumin (OVA), results in hypomethylation of the INF ɣ gene promoter of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, subsequently increasing INF ɣ expression. The increase in INF ɣ results in the secretion of Th2 cytokines, which is associated with an allergic asthma phenotype. Therefore, BPA may induce stable epigenetic alterations (aberrant DNA methylation) of key genes during the development of the immune system which are subsequently inherited by multiple generations. To test this hypothesis an animal model of BALB/c mice were given 10 µg/ml of BPA-treated water prenataly and suboptimally sensitized postnataly with OVA. An unbiased genome-wide DNA methylome analysis coupled with next-generation sequencing (SureSelect Methyl-Seq) identified three genes (Hist1h2bf, Psmb7, and Arid1a) of CD4+ T cells and two genes (Hist1h2bm and Armc9) of CD8+ T cells with differentially methylated promoters compared with controls. Arid1a hypomethylation is associated with chromatin remodeling for induction of gene transcription and Armc9 hypermethylation decreases positive regulation of smoothened signaling and cilium assembly, thereby contributing to the asthma phenotype. Due to their heritability, epigenetic changes induced in the offspring produce lasting multigenerational effects which were confirmed by methylome comparison of the third and fourth generations of mice.",P41,,P41,,Omnivore

This was to provide a novel treatment modality that may reduce side effects in breast cancer patients.  Cell line MCF7 was cultured to ensure sufficient quantity of cells for the experiment. Anti-cancer effects of chemotherapeutic drugs was tested on the MCF7 breast cancer cell line by using the three following drugs:  fluorouracil (5FU), Gamma-tocotrienol(GT3), and oxaliplatin (Oxp). These three drugs were administered as single- and combined-treatments for 24-, 48-, and 72-hour time intervals. Once adequate MCF7 breast cancer cells were achieved, they were seperated and some cells underwent apoptosis using 7-AAD & Annexin V-CF Blue. Apoptotic efficacy was tested through a flow cytometer to determine which treatment was the most effective in eliminating the cancer cells. The results showed that these drugs were more effective at higher concentrations with the most effective drug being 5FU by itself. ",P42,,,P42,Omnivore

As it lacks estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2), TNBC is characterized by its treatment resistance and low survival rates. Hence, plant natural products which have shown cytotoxicity to certain cancer cells, such as the prenylated stilbenoid arachidin-1 (A-1) from peanuts, can be promising adjuvants for chemotherapy drugs. The goal of this study was to examine the cytotoxic effects of A-1 with or without paclitaxel, a non-specific chemotherapy agent, and understand the apoptosis effect of A-1 on TNBC cell lines. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation increases when the cells are undergoing apoptosis triggered by mitochondrial membrane rupture (caspase-8 mediated apoptosis), the additional goal of the project was to measure the ROS activity caused by A-1 treatment. Arachidin-1 was purified from elicitor-treated hairy root cultures of peanut by semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography. The cytotoxic effects of the A-1/paclitaxel treatments were studied in different TNBC cell lines by checkerboard assays. Results show that A-1 decreased the paclitaxel IC50 concentration in TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436) but A-1 alone as well as in combination with paclitaxel did not show significant cytotoxicity in the non-cancerous cell line (MCF-10A). Intracellular ROS generation was disrupted by A-1 treatment. In the MDA-MB-231 treated cells, ROS accumulation increased until 12 h and then plummeted immediately after, while MDA-MB 436 showed a steady increase after 12 h. This highlights the significance of continuing research on prenylated stilbenoids as an adjuvant in TNBC and their potential use to reduce the undesirable side effects of paclitaxel. In future research, we will study A-1 effects on signaling pathways in TNBC ",P43,,P43,,Omnivore

Drug solubility data shows that 40% of approved and 70% of pipeline drugs are poorly soluble (BCS class II and IV) in aqueous solution, which poses a challenge in achieving optimal bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy during drug development. Nanocrystal drug (ND) formulation overcomes the poor solubility of drugs and improves the absorption and bioavailability. Zileuton (ZIL), a BCS class II drug, is used to treat asthma. ZIL inhibits 5-lipoxygenase in the leukotriene production pathway, thereby reducing asthmatic inflammation of the airways, and was chosen as a candidate ND. To evaluate drug solubility and permeability of the ND, rats (10 weeks old male and female) were dosed orally through gelatin capsules containing one of the following: i) active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), ii) physical mixture (PM), or iii) ND ZIL (600 nm size), or iv) an excipient (Kollidon VA64). Two control groups were used: control group-1 untreated rats and control-group-2 rats treated with empty capsule.  We evaluated plasma concentration of ZIL at various time points after drug treatment (1hr, 2hr, 4hr, 6hr and 24hr) and compared the results with control plasma samples. In addition, we collected fecal, urine and intestinal samples, performed liquid-liquid extraction, and then used HPLC-MS to determine the concentration of ZIL in each of these samples. In plasma, the level of ZIL was higher in female rats treated with ND, API and PM than males. Our earlier study shows that intestinal phase-1 and phase-II metabolic enzymes are highly upregulated in males as compared to female animals and it can be correlated for the low level of ZIL in males.

Histological samples of zebrafish are crucial for observing tissue structures related to developmental biology, pathology related to treatment effects, disease states, and tumor classifications. Zebrafish tissues share all the same morphological features as human tissues with the exception of the respiratory and integumentary systems. The utility of zebrafish has produced a wide array of online databases and resources pertaining to zebrafish as an effective model for basic and translational research of human biology and disease. Current best practices and protocols for obtaining zebrafish histological samples were adopted and adapted for our zebrafish lab. Preparation of histology slides involves multiple steps, including euthanasia, necropsy, tissue fixation, dehydration, embedding, mounting, and staining. Optimizing protocols and establishing proper laboratory procedures for each of these steps, including the preparation of routine reagents required for tissue processing and staining, was performed. Specialized laboratory equipment and apparatus also had to be obtained and brought into working order. The end products of these steps are microscope slides of zebrafish tissues sectioned for examination. These histology procedures will be used in the future both to create complete sets of organ tissue slides for undergraduate coursework in Histology, and also in future studies of developmental biology and sex determination in zebrafish based undergraduate research.

The bdelloid Adineta vaga can recover from extensive DNA damage caused by desiccation due to an incredible DNA repair system.  However, it is presently unknown how this DNA repair mechanism works.  When exposed to ionizing radiation, A. vaga experiences DNA double strand breaks in its genome.  Previous work identified an upregulated DNA ligase homolog in irradiated bdelloids called DNA ligase K (LIGK).  This project aims to uncover the origin and function of LIGK in bdelloid rotifers.  We identified four copies of LIGK in the A. vaga genome.  Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that LIGK is within a lineage distinct from DNA ligases 1, 3, and 4, which are universal to most eukaryotes, including bdelloid rotifers.  The domain structure of LIGK proteins was also distinct from DNA ligases 1, 3, and 4.  To investigate the function of LIGK, we used CRISPR to inactivate the gene.  First, we designed and amplified single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to target LIGK and DNA ligase 4 (LIG4), which we included in this study since it is involved in double-strand break repair in most eukaryotes.  We verified that the sgRNA/Cas9 complexes cut each target gene using an in vitro cleavage assay.  Single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) templates were designed to insert mutations into each target gene via homology-directed repair.  To perform CRISPR for each gene, embryos were electroporated with the sgRNA/Cas9 complex and ssODN.  We used PCR to screen embryos for mutations.  Once identified, mutants will be tested and assessed on their ability to recover from desiccation to ultimately uncover if the DNA repair process is affected.  This research is important because it will broaden our understanding of DNA repair beyond traditional model organisms.",P46,,,P46,Omnivore

In our study, we are interested in examining macrophage detection and response against intracellular pathogens. Immune cells battle with the most significant challenge of these intracellular bacteria because these pathogens evade traditional defenses by hiding inside host cells. Traditionally, inflammasomes detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or activities and activate inflammatory caspase-1 or caspase-11. These in turn cleave the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD), which inserts into membranes resulting in a form of cell death called pyroptosis. Resident macrophages are the first cells that are in charge of responding to invading pathogens. In this study, we will examine macrophage interaction with Shigella flexneri (Sfl) to investigate how macrophage uses inflammasome signaling to detect and respond to S. flexneri virulence. All while considering the intriguing hypothesis that macrophages trigger pyroptosis to drive chromatin relaxation forming DNA-histone traps that immobilize and target the bacteria for clearance.

Although CBD, in the form of Epidiolex, has been approved by the FDA to treat rare forms of epilepsy, there is little research on the safety and effectiveness of CBD in other settings. Following the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, easy and unregulated access to CBD allows for anyone to purchase CBD including pregnant mothers. THC and cannabis are known to harm children during pregnancy, but CBD has not been as thoroughly assessed. Many mothers perceive CBD use as safe because it is thought of as a natural drug; however, there is no research to support the safety of cannabidiol use during pregnancy. One study has shown decreased fetal body weights and an increase in structural variations following CBD exposure (Huestis, 2019). The public and the FDA need to be aware of CBD’s effects on fetal outcomes to make informed decisions on a drug that could potentially cause harm. In this experiment, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged with 0, 15, 20, 100, or 250 mg/kg CBD from gestational day six until the day of parturition. Offspring were then administered the same dose from postnatal day (PND) 1-21. Following weaning, rats underwent an extensive behavioral test battery. Here, early social behavior and anxiety-like behavior from adolescence through early adulthood are presented. Initial analysis suggests that perinatal CBD has little effect on these behaviors in healthy rats. Further behavioral and neurochemical tests will be analyzed to examine potential perinatal effects of CBD.",P48,,,P48,Omnivore

The samples are irradiated with a diode laser centered at 808 nm and their temperature profiles are taken when the laser is on and off. Moreover, the variables for each experiment such as laser intensity and frequency are studied in detail. In water, it is found that the concentration of the samples affects the amount of energy absorbed and the rate constant of heat dissipation. The higher the concentration of the sample, the more energy is absorbed. By contrast, samples with lower concentrations have a larger rate constant of heat dissipation. The energy absorbed and dissipated are analyzed quantitatively at varying irradiation conditions. Additionally, a comparison of samples placed in the two different matrices (water versus gel phantom) is performed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the photothermal properties of the gold nanocages.

Unresolved G4s can result in stalling of the replication fork, causing double-strand breaks, chromosomal fragmentation, and subsequent cell death. Certain translesion synthesis polymerases, such as Rev1, are necessary for efficient DNA replication without loss of vital genetic information. Rev1 has the unique ability to unfold G4s and recruit other proteins to further assist in G4 bypass. Previous research has shown the importance of Rev1 in preventing the accumulation of single-stranded DNA and the binding affinity of Rev1 to G4s. Our next step is to observe the interactions of Rev1 with specialized proteins necessary for G4 bypass. Proteomics results led to the discovery that the DEAH-box helicase 36 (DHX36) was depleted near replication forks in the absence of Rev1. DHX36 is a helicase with proposed mechanisms of assisting G4 bypass by creating a loading zone for the replicative helicase downstream of the quadruplex structure. While Rev1 and DHX36 have been independently implicated in G4 bypass, no previous research has established a physical or functional relationship between them. To investigate the relationship between Rev1 and DHX36, we performed chromatin fractionation experiments to determine if the presence of Rev1 influences the relative abundance of DHX36 on chromatin. We also performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to establish a physical interaction between Rev1 and DHX36. Completion of the proposed studies could provide new mechanistic insights into G4 replication and maintenance. ",P52,,,P52,Omnivore

During diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, deposition of amyloid-beta-42 (Ab42) causes microglial activation and brain inflammation. Iron accumulation is coincident with Ab42 toxicity in microglia, however mechanisms that mediate a potential interaction are not well understood. We identified Normal Mucosa of Esophagus-Specific Gene 1 (NMES1) as a putative intersection point of iron and Ab42 using proteomic analysis of mouse microglia. We found Ab42 increases NMES1 expression whereas iron decreases it. The goal of our current study was to elucidate the role of NMES1 in microglial responses to stimuli such as Ab42. The NMES1 protein is a paralog of the mitochondrial protein, NDUFA4 and the replacement of NDUFA4 with NMES1 is a mechanism to suppress inflammation. Using flow cytometry, we found that NMES1 and NDUFA4 expression was increased in response to Ab42, but at different ratios. Cells cultured in elevated iron had decreased NMES1 and elevated NDUFA4 as compared to those without iron in the media. The NMES1 gene (C15orf48) also produces a microRNA, mir-147b, that is implicated in suppressing inflammation. We measured gene expression of C15orf48 by PCR and found that Ab42 elevated NMES1 and mir-147b transcripts whereas iron decreased expression. These data suggest that iron may prevent regulation of inflammation. To determine the influence of mir-147b we transfected cultured microglia with a mir-147b inhibitor during stimulation with Ab42. We found that mir-147b inhibition elevated cell inflammation, indicating that mir-147b is a major regulator of microglial activation. More work is needed to understand the complete role of mir-147b and NMES1 on microglial activation. However, our results suggest that elevated iron may promote microglial activation in response to disease-associated stimuli by suppressing regulators of inflammation, namely NMES1 and mir-147b.

Hamilton,Ouachita Baptist University,,,,,"Wound healing is a complex biological process, with one of the most crucial phases being the remolding of the tissues, which centers around the collagen present in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Degradable collagen mimics can be used to enhance and aid internal wound healing capabilities and to deliver therapeutics to local wound sites. Electrospinning natural and synthetic polymers has produced nanofibrous mats that mimic the architecture of the ECM for use in biomedical applications. Traditionally, the Hamilton lab has electrospun antimicrobial chitosan and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with novel, non-degradable collagen mimics to produce nanofiber scaffolds. Alginate, a natural polymer, can also be electrospun to produce materials for wound healing. The innate groups in alginate lend themselves towards modification to produce a biomimetic and degradable polymer that can be electrospun.  Using a new concerted synthesis for the modification of alginate allows for the attachment of four functional groups via amide coupling and can be facilely conducted in an undergraduate research laboratory. This product can be oxidized to enhance alginate degradability. The modified alginate was co-spun with PVA to create nanofibrous scaffolding. The physical properties of these materials were characterized through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Cellular responses to these alginate-based fiber mats were examined including cell viability, proliferation, and migration. Ongoing nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis will compare the efficiency of functional group attachments of this synthetic approach as compared to a traditional stepwise modification of this polymer. Future studies include analyzing antimicrobial properties and in vivo assays. ",T7,,,,Omnivore

Excised human skin is the current ‘gold standard’ for in-vitro permeation testing (IVPT); however, skin explants can vary significantly from donor to donor and are limited by availability and high costs.  A variety of alternative skin barrier models have been produced, including reconstructed human epidermal models (RhEs), full-thickness skin equivalents (FTSEs), and artificial membranes.  While these models have been utilized in a variety of studies, they have not been thoroughly assessed in comparison to human skin for use in IVPT.  EpiDerm, an RhE from MatTek, Strat-M, an artificial membrane from Sigma-Aldrich, and bio-printed FTSEs were compared to excised human skin.  Barrier function was assessed through trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) and IVPT.  IVPT was conducted using Franz diffusion cells, consisting of a donor and receptor compartment between which the membrane is mounted.  Each membrane was dosed with caffeine, salicylic acid, or testosterone (chemicals common in topical cosmetics or drugs) in combination with a vehicle of either phosphate-buffered saline or ethanol.  The test chemicals were radiolabeled with 14C, and permeation was assessed by measuring the radioactivity of samples taken at various time points via liquid scintillation counting.  Our data show that permeations profiles vary by chemical and skin barrier model; however, human skin explants have the strongest barrier function overall.  Continued improvement and systematic evaluation of alternative skin models is necessary to be adopted for IVPT in regulatory science.",P54,,,P54,Omnivore

During elongation, FACT – which in S. cerevisiae is composed of two proteins, Spt16 and Pob3 – contributes to the disassembly of nucleosomes in front of Pol II and to their reassembly following Pol II passage.  In previous work we identified a nucleosomal region – termed ISGI (Influences Spt16-Gene Interactions) – that plays an important role in promoting proper interactions between FACT and transcribed genes.   More specifically, mutations within this region cause an accumulation of FACT at the 3’ ends of genes, an effect we attribute to impaired FACT dissociation from genes following transcription.   Two recent studies have unveiled an association between a mutation within one of the two genes that encode the human histone H3.3 protein and neurodevelopmental disorders in patients.  This mutation results in a substitution of the ISGI residue L61 to an arginine (H3.3-L61R), and, if this mutation is indeed responsible for the disease phenotype, it must act in a dominant fashion since the genomes of these patients also harbor three alleles encoding wild type histone H3.3.  Our work in yeast has shown that most substitutions at H3-L61 cause strong defects in Spt16-gene interactions, but the H3-L61R mutant had not yet been tested since it does not sustain viability on its own.  In the present study, we tested H3-L61R for possible dominant effects in conferring defects in Spt16-gene interactions and found that it not only operates in a dominant fashion, but it does so also in cells that express the mutant protein from one of four histone H3-encoding alleles.  These results, combined with other studies linking loss of function mutations in human Spt16 and neurodevelopmental disorders, provide a possible molecular mechanism underlying the development disorders seen in patients expressing the histone H3.3-L61R mutant.",P55,,P55,,Herbivore (Vegetarian)

The mechanisms behind how offspring are programmed for metabolic dysfunction due to maternal nutrition, however, needs to be elucidated. Leptin is a hormone secreted by adipose tissue and regulates appetite. A surge in leptin was characterized in mice during the first postnatal week, peaking at PND10, and occurs independent of adipose mass. Current work in the Childs lab supports published data showing that the postnatal leptin surge in mice can be blunted or shifted depending on the severity of the maternal undernutrition. Musashi (MSI), a translational regulator, was reported by the Childs/MacNicol group to increase in mice lacking leptin receptors in somatotropes. The focus of this study is to determine the effect of an altered neonatal leptin surge, due to maternal undernutrition, on Msi mRNA expression in the pituitary. The hypothesis is that a 30% maternal caloric restriction mice model will decrease serum leptin at PND10 and cause an increase in MSI gene expression in the pituitary. We will characterize in the offspring of ad libitum (control) fed and 30% calorically restricted dams (CR30) serum neonatal leptin and pituitary Msi mRNA expression. To initially determine the impact of low leptin on Msi expression, we measured serum leptin and Msi targets (extracted by immunoprecipitation) at postnatal-day (PND) 4, 5, and 15, when leptin expression is expected to be low. Interestingly, mRNA was not detected at PND4 and PND5 but was detected at PND15. Pituitaries and trunk serum of offspring from underfed (CR30) and fed dams are currently being collected at PND10, where serum leptin and pituitary Msi will be quantified. This data will complete the characterization of an altered neonatal leptin curve and Msi regulation, which will provide insight into maternal nutritional programing on pituitary development.

Failed G4 bypass leads to the formation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which can further collapse into strand breaks, causing chromosomal fragmentation and genomic instability. Furthermore, failed bypass of G4 motifs disrupts recycling of regulatory histone post-translational modifications, resulting in disrupted chromatin structure and epigenetic instability. The translesion synthesis polymerase Rev1 has been implicated in G4 maintenance, and understanding its role in G4 replication will provide new insight into replication mechanisms that promote bypass of these barriers. We found that WT HEK293 cells had an EC50 value more than double that of REV1 knockout (REV1KO) cells when treated with pyridostatin (PDS), a G4 stabilizer. To test the impact of Rev1 loss on ssDNA gap formation, we performed non-denaturing immunofluorescence with CldU incorporation. REV1KO cells showed higher levels of CldU incorporation compared to controls, especially with PDS treatment. These results suggest that global ssDNA formation is elevated in REV1KO cells experiencing G4-induced stress, indicating the importance of Rev1 in resolving G4 structures during replication. We performed isolation of proteins on nascent DNA coupled with mass spectrometry (iPOND-MS) in HEK293 WT and REV1KO cells to identify Rev1-dependent proteins associated with G4 replication. We discovered that a DExH-Box helicase, DHX36, was depleted at the fork in REV1KO cells with PDS treatment. We also found that helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF), a fork reversal protein, was enriched in REV1KO cells with PDS treatment. These results are supportive of the idea that Rev1 recruits proteins to replication forks under G4-associated stress, and the absence of Rev1 may affect the presence of other replication stress response proteins at the fork.",P56,,,P56,Omnivore

AD pathology is characterized by accumulation of amyloid beta(Aβ) aggregates and build-up of tau protein, contributing to neuronal death. In addition, the function of the blood-brain barrier(BBB) is disrupted by the accumulation of these toxic aggregates. Pre-clinical models used to study AD include transgenic mice and rats that overexpress human genes associated with AD pathology. However, they fail to recapitulate the full spectrum of human AD pathology including neuronal loss and BBB dysfunction. To overcome limitations in modeling AD pathology, novel technologies that recapitulate human-specific characteristics have been developed, including the use of human induced pluripotent stem cells(hiPSCs). hiPSCs are derived from somatic cells and have been reprogrammed into a pluripotent state, enabling derivation of any cell type. In this study, hiPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells (iBMVECs) and pericytes will be used to characterize some of the pathological features observed in AD brain vasculature. To achieve cell-specific differentiation, hiPSCs from a healthy individual and an AD patient will be cultured in cell-specific media to obtain iBMVECs and iPericytes. Successful differentiation of these cells will be corroborated by analysis of cell-specific markers and proteins related to AD pathology and BBB function via immunocytochemistry (ICC) and western blot analysis. Given that AD patients present a dysfunctional BBB, we expect that iBMVECs from AD patients will have reduced expression of tight junction proteins and membrane bound transporters. iPericytes from AD patients will also present overexpression of toxic protein aggregates. These results would indicate that hiPSCs derived from AD patients can be used for disease modeling and may be a powerful tool for safety and efficacy testing of FDA-regulated products for the potential treatment of AD.

Recently, host-microbiome interaction, especially intestinal barrier effects and the gut-liver axis, has gained interest. This study focuses on the effect of the HF/HS diet on this interaction. Factors investigated in this study were intestinal epithelial cell integrity, immune response, and microbial population. The goal of this study is to investigate strain and sex specific differences between two strains used in said previous study (CC042, CC011) that showed highly distinguished responses to the diet. Tissues from male and female mice who were fed HF/HS diets or normal diets (20 weeks to 40 weeks) were used in this study*. The mRNA expression of 84 genes known to be associated with intestinal epithelial cell integrity were analyzed from mouse ileum using qPCR. Microbial gut population (fecal) was investigated by 16s rRNA sequencing. There was no difference in the mRNA expression in CC042 male animals (20 weeks). In contrast, CC042 HF/HS females (20 weeks) showed differential regulation of several genes (primarily down-regulation); only Gap junction protein beta 1 (Gjb1) was significantly downregulated (p=0.03; FR -4.59). CC011 HF/HS females (5 of 6) were moribund before week 20; endpoint analysis for this strain, along with CC011 males (all survived) is currently ongoing.

Cellular senescence has been observed in several obesity-related pathologies such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This senescence is a permanent state of cell cycle arrest and is characterized by the release of various biomolecules together known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Macrophages play a critical role in the initiation and resolution of inflammation, an important contributing factor to cardiovascular disease. Cells can be driven into senescence by various stressors and cause nearby macrophages to secrete inflammatory factors. However, it is not very well understood if specifically, macrophages can be directly affected by these stimuli and become senescent, and therefore present a pro-inflammatory environment. Here, we hypothesize that obesogenic factors may trigger macrophage senescence, which in turn, could increase inflammation. To test our hypothesis, we used murine macrophages (RAW264.7) that were exposed to plasma collected from obese mice. Untreated cells were considered as the control group for all experiments. Cell viability was unaffected by plasma administration. Total protein isolated from these cells was subject to western blotting for SASP markers. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a hallmark of senescence, was significantly upregulated in macrophages that were exposed to the plasma from obese mice compared to controls. We are currently assessing senescence using other SASP markers and assays including the senescence-associated-b-gal assay. Our preliminary data suggest that obesogenic factors may cause macrophage senescence. This could result in acute as well as chronic inflammation and tissue damage in obesity and associated health conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.",T10,T10,,,Omnivore

BPA is an endocrine disruptor that has been linked to various health problems: reduced fertility, alterations in fetal development, and certain cancers. BPA can be absorbed dermally, which is a concern for women who use feminine hygiene products that contain BPA. Previous work in our lab determined that it is possible to monitor BPA leaching from panty liners over time into a 50% methanol/water solution using fluorescence spectrophotometry. My summer research project focused on determining the effects on the leaching of BPA from panty liners caused by changing the pH of the methanol/water solution to mimic variations in vaginal pH. BPA leaching was monitored by measuring the fluorescence emission of samples using the FS-5 spectrofluorometer from Edinburgh Instruments. BPA is a fluorescent compound that is excited at 278 nm and emits at 304 nm. A calibration curve was obtained for BPA emission versus concentration, which allowed us to determine the linear range, limit of detection, and limit of quantitation for our method. Due to the complex sample matrix and small concentrations of BPA in pantiliners, the standard addition method was used. The top layer of netting from three pantiliners was collected, cut into small squares, and placed into beakers that contained 100-mL 50% methanol/water. One beaker was used for each time analysis point, which ranged from 0 minutes to 6 hours. At each time point, aliquots of solution were removed from the beaker and used to prepare standard addition samples. Fluorescence emission data were obtained in quadruplicate and plotted in standard addition curves to calculate the concentration of BPA at each time point, which allowed us to monitor BPA release over time.

However, the mechanism for this type of repair is unknown. Chromatin (DNA and histone proteins) regulates DNA repair in many eukaryotes. Interestingly, the seven histone H2A proteins in the bdelloid Adineta vaga have C-terminal tails longer than those found in other animals, which could implicate these proteins have a role in DNA repair. Our project's objective is to determine which of the histone H2A genes in A. vaga may be involved in DNA repair. Firstly, we used 3’Random Amplification of cDNA Ends (3’RACE) to sequence the 3’UTRs of the seven H2A genes. In eukaryotes, H2A genes that have polyadenylated mRNA are associated with cellular functions that can include DNA repair, however core histone H2A genes involved in replication lack polyadenylated mRNAs and instead possess a histone downstream element (HDE). Thus, polyadenylated H2A genes that we found using 3’RACE were the strongest candidates for genes involved in DNA repair. Secondly, by inactivating the H2Abd3 gene using CRISPR genome editing we further investigated the potential role it plays in DNA repair. We designed and amplified a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct Cas9 to the target sequence within the gene. We also designed a single-stranded deoxyoligoucleotide (ssODN) template to introduce mutations via homology directed repair following Cas9 cleavage. Using an in vitro Cas9 cleavage assay, we verified that the sgRNA/Cas9 complex cut the H2Abd3 target site. We carried out CRISPR by introducing the sgRNA/Cas9 complexes and the ssODN template to A. vaga embryos via electroporation. Then, PCR screening for the desired mutation suggested CRISPR was successful. We will conduct desiccation recovery assays on mutants to determine if H2Abd3 influences DNA repair. This will help us understand this extraordinary DNA repair system in these unusual animals.",T12,T12,,,Omnivore

Polymerase k (pol k) is a widely conserved y-family polymerase capable of replicating DNA with oxidative lesions. Human pol k is upregulated in gliomas including glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis and mostly palliative therapies available. Development of GBM increases with oxidative stress. Among the most common oxidative lesions is the guanine derivative 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2 ¢-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), which pol  k often copies incorrectly by preferentially inserting 2¢-deoxyadenosine monophosphate (dAMP). When 8-oxo-dG is paired with dAMP, the MutYH DNA glycosylase (MUTYH) removes the adenine and base excision repair (BER) adds back cytosine, which allows 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) to remove the 8-oxo-dG lesion. Both pol k and MUTYH have been linked with activation of the ATR kinase-mediated replication stress response but a mechanism relating the two enzymes has not been found. The present study will test the hypothesis that pol k-catalyzed insertion of dAMP opposite 8-oxo-dG increases recruitment of MUTYH to chromatin in GBM cells and that this activates the replication stress response. We have isolated chromatin from GBM-derived T98G cells and performed Western blotting to determine if WT and POLKKO cells have different amounts of chromatin-bound MUTYH.

Previous in vitro studies in the Delgado-Calle lab using cell lines indicate that BCa cells induce senescence in osteocytes, the most abundant cells of bone tissue. In turn, factors released by osteocytes increase proliferation, migration, and invasion capacity of BCa cells. The molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of interactions between osteocytes and BCa bone metastasis remain understudied. In my summer intership, I used ex vivo calvarial bone organ culture and found that BCa conditioned medium (CM) upregulated the expression of senescence markers (p16, p21) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (Mmp13, Mmp9, Vcam-1) in primary osteocytes. Further, I used the in situ hybridization technique RNAscope, and found that 50% BCa-CM induced an increase in p16-positive primary osteocytes. Together, these findings confirmed that BCa cells genetically reprogram osteocytes to induce senescence. Next, I will study if senescent osteocytes promote BCa proliferation. I will use senolytics to selectively kill senescent osteocytes. Then, CM from osteocyte cultures treated with/without senolytics will be added to BCa cells to determine the impact of factors released by senescent osteocytes on BCa cell proliferation. Collectively, these studies will improve our understanding of the cross-talk interactions between osteocytes and BCa cells and their implications on BCa progression in bone. ",P65,,P65,,Omnivore

However, oxidative stress is caused by the buildup of free radicals, which damage cells. Microglial cells are Central Nervous System resident immune cells that are particularly sensitive to oxidative stress. Inflammation results from oxidative stress and the microglial response to disease-associated stimuli such as amyloid beta (Aβ). In microglia, the enzymes inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and Arginase are determinants of pro- and anti-inflammatory responses of microglia, respectively. Microglial dysfunction, resulting from oxidative stress, has been implicated in the potentiation of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and is associated with elevated iron. However, the relationship between redox-active iron, oxidative stress, and microglial inflammation is unclear. Therefore, we used immortalized murine microglia to study this relationship. We treated cells with ferristatin, a transferrin receptor inhibitor and putative radical scavenger, with and without Aβ stimulation. We determined that ferristatin decreases ROS generation in cultured microglia. We then measured iNOS and Arginase enzyme activity to study the effect of ferristatin on the activation state of microglia. Cells stimulated with Aβ and treated with ferristatin had decreased iNOS and increased Arginase activity compared to Aβ-stimulated cells. This indicates that ferristatin pushes microglia away from a pro-inflammatory state and towards an anti-inflammatory state. These data point to a pro-inflammatory role for free radicals generated by iron, but the complete mechanism of how iron interacts with Aβ and contributes to disease-associated inflammation in microglia is unknown. However, our results indicate that dysregulation of redox-active iron promotes oxidative stress that promotes inflammation and modulates microglial responses to extrinsic stimuli.

Macroautophagy contributes to differentiation of osteoblast to osteocytes that are embedded in the bone. In previous studies, autophagy was eliminated in the entire osteoblast lineage via conditional knockout of atg-7 in mice utilizing cre recombinase under the osterix1 (osx1) promoter. After the conditional knockout of atg-7 a significant decrease in cortical bone thickness and increase in fracture frequency was observed. This low bone mass phenotype was associated with low bone formation in conjunction with decreased bone resorption as well. This decrease in bone turnover was due to decreased osteoclast number and osteoblast number. Furthermore, It was observed that osteocyte morphology was altered in atg-7 flox;osx1-cre mice. Notably, in the cellular projections that produce the osteocyte network. The osteocyte network is speculated to play a role in sensing and responding to mechanical load. Piezo1 is a calcium sensing receptor in osteocytes. This receptor can be selectively activated by a small molecule named Yoda1, such activation is speculated to mimic mechanical loading. We hypothesize that morphologically altered osteocyte networks contribute to low bone mass of atg-7 flox;osx1-cre mice. To test this we will stimulate bone organ cultures in vitro with Yoda1.

In response to a bacterial infection, the mammalian immune system targets iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters inside the bacteria by producing high concentrations of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (in particular, NO) to disrupt FeS activity which inactivates proteins and kill the bacteria. Some drugs utilize this process to fight infection, but bacteria have evolved defenses against NO. Thus, understanding the mechanisms behind this defense is essential to developing effective treatment. Here, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic techniques were employed to study the mechanisms of NO reduction and FeS cluster repair by YtfE, a non-heme diiron enzyme that is essential to the bacterial response system. EPR serves as a site-specific probe for the active site of YtfE.

The anatomical and genetic similarities shared by humans and zebrafish make establishing a zebrafish laboratory advantageous for undergraduate research and coursework. Zebrafish feeding protocols utilize two primary food types: dry (flake or pelleted) food and live prey such as artemia (brine shrimp) or rotifers. Adopting a feeding protocol that incorporates both dry and live feed optimizes considerations of nutrition and cost for maintaining healthy fish. Best practices for feeding were adapted from authoritative sources in the current literature and published standards. Source, amount, regularity, and scheduling were optimized for our new zebrafish laboratory. Breeding zebrafish is necessary to maintain stock during ongoing experiments involving necropsy as well as studying developmental changes in zebrafish. Breeding protocols utilize a collection of special apparatus and environmental cues that produce the appropriate behavioral conditions for spawning. The key environmental cues are the onset of light in the morning, controlled by room light timers and angled and shallow breeding tank apparatus to imitate the shallow waters zebrafish naturally spawn in. A special slotted, false bottom tank is used to isolate eggs away from the natural predation of adult zebrafish. Eggs are collected by siphoning several hours after lights on and numbers are estimated by volume. Best practices for zebrafish breeding were tested and adapted to optimize egg and embryo production. Optimizing and adapting these protocols for our new laboratory are necessary for establishing a successful zebrafish laboratory with standard operating procedures in supporting future research.

Such interference prevented the accurate detection of urea in the medium. The kit from BioAssay Systems had a negligible background signal and acceptable sensitivity, thus, it can be used to measure urea in the medium from the PHHs in a reliable manner.

PDAC is particularly challenging to screen and also has a complex pathophysiology that leads to a late-stage diagnosis and a dismal 5-year survival rate of ~10%. Radiation therapy is a critical treatment option for PDAC, although resistance to radiation remains a clinical obstacle. Cell cycle dynamics are known to impact the response of cancer cells to radiation and we have found that the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), a regulatory enzyme that controls the G2/M checkpoint in the cell cycle plays a critical role in PDAC radiation response. Our studies have found that inhibition of CDK1  diminished PDAC cells’ ability to initiate DNA repair pathways at this point in the cell cycle, making CDK1 a candidate for radiosensitizing therapeutic. We hypothesize combining radiation treatment with CDK1 inhibition therapy will lead to greater cell death than either treatment alone.  Our results have found that treatment of PDAC cells in vitro with a selective CDK1 inhibitor, RO-3306, results in a 2-fold increase of DNA damage following 4 Gy of radiation via measurement of gamma H2AX nuclear foci. Furthermore, we found that RO-3306 (10 μM) treatment concurrent with radiation resulted in decreased clonogenic survival with increasing radiation dose. To translate this concept into a clinically relevant PDAC model, we have generated inducible shRNA CDK1 knockdown PDAC cell lines via. a doxycycline promoter. We plan to inject these cells in vivo orthotopically into the pancreas of mice and compare cell growth with and without knockdown of CDK1 concurrent with radiation therapy. Our studies will elucidate the role of CDK1 in radiation response and further develop a novel radiosensitizing strategy for the deadly disease of PDAC.",P73,,P73,,Omnivore

Arthrospira platensis, commonly known as Spirulina, could be a possible solution to these problems. This cyanobacterium converts carbon dioxide into pure oxygen and the cell structure (coiled or straight) triggers different oxygen and cultivation responses. Coiled and mixed (coiled and straight) Spirulina cultures were transferred into 2.5 L containers and placed in white light boxes with varying intensities of light: 15 µmol/㎡/s, 7 µmol/㎡/s, and 3 µmol/㎡/s.

High-intensity light produced a significant amount of oxygen as compared to low-intensity light. The coiled Spirulina in low light intensity was the most successful at a continuous growth rate. Based on the results of this experiment, coiled Spirulina produce more oxygen at the higher light intensity of 15 µmol/㎡/s, providing a solution for scientists as a way to consume carbon dioxide and produce oxygen in space as well as a nutrient source, due to the high vitamin and protein content.

Borrelia belongs to a genus of Gram-negative spirochetes that includes the causative pathogen of tickborne relapsing fever; Borrelia turicatae. The signaling pathways that contribute to B. turicatae virulence and infection are unknown, but the cyclic dimeric AMP (c-di-AMP) pathway is an important regulatory network in Gram-positive bacteria that is critical for environmental adaptation and virulence. The c-di-AMP pathway consists of three components i) a diadenylate cyclase (DAC) which synthesizes c-di-AMP ii) a phosphodiesterase (PDE) that degrades c-di-AMP and iii) a receptor that binds c-di-AMP. Borrelia encodes for one known DAC (CdaA) and one c-di-AMP PDE (Dhhp). B. turicatae also encodes a predicted regulatory protein for CdaA called CdaR. Prior studies demonstrated that CdaA is required for mammalian infection, and we are interested in characterizing the function of DhhP and CdaR in B. turicatae. We hypothesize that DhhP and CdaR are important for mammalian infection, and to test this, genetic constructs to inactivate dhhP and cdaR were created in Escherichia coli and then transformed into wild type B. turicatae. We also conducted several phenotypic assays on previously confirmed Bt∆cdaA mutant and Bt∆cdaAC-cis complement strain alongside wild type B. turicatae. These assays measured sensitivity to reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, motility, and serum resistance. Experiments to generate the dhhP and cdaR mutants are ongoing. We observed that the CdaA mutant’s resistance to human serum, oxidative stress, and nitrogen stress was comparable to wild type B. turicatae, but the CdaA mutant did exhibit a significant defect in motility. While the precise physiological contribution of CdaA in B. turicatae is still unknown, these data provide further insight into why CdaA may be essential for B. turicatae mammalian infection.",P75,,P75,,Omnivore

By electrospinning nanofiber mats from biomaterials such as collagen, researchers have achieved materials that mimic the morphology and components of the extracellular matrix. However, many of these dressings are not readily degradable, are not always antibacterial, and are expensive to produce. By using polycaprolactone (PCL), a biodegradable polyester, and chitosan, an antibacterial biomacromolecule, the electrospun nanofibers developed would ideally be biodegradable, inherently antibacterial, and inexpensive. The goal of this research is to develop a material with these properties that can be electrospun into a nanofiber scaffold. This project has focused on the optimization of the synthesis of a novel biomimetic polycaprolactone (bPCL). This bPCL was prepared by modifying caprolactone bearing a pendant-protected carboxyl group via amide coupling reactions to attach molecules that mimic the amino acids most abundant in collagen, then polymerizing that final product. By optimizing the steps of this synthesis, a purer monomer product could be obtained, leading to a better polymer for study. Additionally, electrospinning protocols for PCL and chitosan fiber mats were further studied and established through electrospinning trials. These protocols were applied to bPCL/chitosan solutions to produce nanofiber scaffolds. In the future the mats will be analyzed via degradation and in vitro assays. It is anticipated that these studies will further confirm that these mats are biomimetic, antibacterial, and degradable and thus verifying the utility of these mats in biomedical applications.

While the cell cycle dependent metabolisms of proteins and DNA are extensively studies, the cell cycle-dependent synthesis and transport of membrane lipids is emerging as an active research topic. One of our longevity mutant Perg6-OSH6 in yeast has large cell size, a sign of elevated membrane lipids. Osh6 is a non-vesicular lipid transporter and traps one of its lipid ligand phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) on the trans-Golgi network. To explore connections between Osh6 and membrane lipid metabolism, we compared the morphological changes of the budding process of wild type, Perg6-OSH6, and other osh mutants upon titration of different lipid ligands of Osh6. This comparison showed that Perg6-OSH6 upon titration of PI(4,5)P2 prolonged the G2 phase while Perg6-OSH5 under the same manipulation extended the G2 and M phases. A delay from G2 to M transition is a sign of TORC1 down-regulation, which is consistent with the pro-longevity effect of up-regulation of Osh6. The delay in G2/M transition is depends on Swe1, which stimulates the lipolysis of triacylglycerides (TAG) to diacylglycerides (DAG) and fatty acids. In support, Perg6-OSH5 had more detectable DAG signals than the wild type. However, Perg6-OSH6 had less DAG signals, suggesting that up-regulated Osh6 may use lipid resources other than TAG. Such resources could be the recycling of membranes via vacuoles since up-regulation of Osh6 enhances vacuolar functions. These discoveries provide a new mechanistic link between lipid metabolism and the cell cycle progression. ",P81,,P81,,Omnivore

It unwinds virus DNA or RNA in a 5’ to 3’ direction with the help of a nucleotide triphosphate. The goal of this project is to use X-ray crystallography to characterize complexes of NSP13 with target drugs identified in the Raney lab. The approach is to prepare recombinant NSP-13 protein using an N-terminal hexahistidine SUMO fusion expression construct provided by Dr. Raney’s lab. The protein will be purified by nickel affinity chromatography, ULP1 proteolytic removal of the SUMO tag, and size exclusion chromatography. Initial purification experiments have generated a pure species of the predicted size based on SDS-PAGE analysis. The purified protein will be co-crystallized with drug molecules for structure determination by X-ray crystallography. These structures are anticipated to reveal NSP13 drug binding pockets and the inhibition mechanism, which may help elucidate the role of NSP13 in the SARS-CoV2 lifecycle and aid in further anti-viral drug development.
